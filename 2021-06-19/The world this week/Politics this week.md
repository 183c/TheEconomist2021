The two sides agreed to return their ambassadors, who were recalled earlier this year, and said they would work on new nuclear-arms-control measures. Mr Biden criticised Russia’s human-rights record, but said the topic should be dealt with separately from other matters, such as security and climate change. Mr Putin denied that Russia engages in cyber-attacks.
China rejected criticism made by G7 countries at their summit in Britain. The G7 had called for peace in the Taiwan Strait and asked China to respect human rights, especially in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Myanmar’s ruling junta put Aung San Suu Kyi on trial behind closed doors. The army, which took power in a coup in February, has charged the country’s former leader with seven crimes, including corruption and possessing walkie-talkies. If found guilty she faces decades in prison.
Tens of thousands of people rallied in Madrid against the government’s plan to pardon 12 separatists from Catalonia who were behind an illegal independence referendum in 2017. Nine of the separatists were found guilty of sedition, in what was Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades. Some 60% of Spaniards oppose their pardons.

 in England for what had been labelled “Freedom Day”. Cases of the Delta (Indian) variant are rising. Britain’s prime minister hopes that by July 19th two-thirds of the population will be fully vaccinated and restrictions can at last end.

A judge found that Joe Biden may have exceeded his presidential powers when he stopped issuing licences to drill for oil and gas on federal land, one of his first orders as president. Granting an injunction against the order, the judge said that only Congress could take such action.

Pedro Castillo, a hard-leftist, claimed victory in Peru’s presidential election. He finished 44,000 votes ahead of his rival, Keiko Fujimori, the hard-right daughter of a former president. She claims that the count was inflated by fraud and has promised to challenge the result in court.

Mr Bennett faced an immediate test when Jewish nationalists marched through the Old City of Jerusalem, some chanting racist slogans. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, launched incendiary balloons at Israel, which responded with air strikes in Gaza. There were no casualties. It was their first big clash since last month.
Lebanon’s currency, which has lost more than 90% of its value since October 2019, hit a new low. The country is mired in an economic crisis that has left it short of basic goods such as fuel and medicine. Efforts to form a new government remain stalled.
America is considering a plan to send commandos back to Somalia. This would partly reverse a decision by Donald Trump, who withdrew all 700 American troops from the country. The soldiers would train Somali forces battling al-Shabab, a jihadist group.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organisation, warned that , and now, “not next year”. The G7 had just promised 1bn doses. At least 11bn will be required if 70% of the world’s population is to be vaccinated by the time the G7 meet again in 2022.

The number of infections continued to fall in India. Tourist attractions, including the Taj Mahal, re-opened to visitors. There are worries that easing restrictions will cause a new wave of cases.

California and New York lifted almost all their remaining restrictions. The number of new infections in both states are at their lowest levels since the start of the crisis.
Tanzania said it would release data on covid-19 infections for the first time in more than a year. This would make the IMF and World Bank more likely to disburse funds. Tanzania’s late president, John Magufuli, had halted the publication of such statistics. He also denied there was covid in his country, and said that vaccines did not work.
