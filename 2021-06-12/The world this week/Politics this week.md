Democrats had to rethink their plan to pass comprehensive legislation on electoral reform, known as the For the People Act, when Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, said he would not support it because it lacked Republican support.

A court in Moscow ruled that two organisations connected to Alexei Navalny, a jailed opposition leader in Russia, were “extremist”, and thus should be shut down and their members barred from standing in elections.

The hearing was held behind closed doors.
The European Commission launched legal proceedings against Germany’s Constitutional Court to assert the primacy of European Union law. The case relates to the German court’s ruling last year that the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme contravenes the German constitution.
