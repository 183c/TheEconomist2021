The service expanded to include almost anyone who was homebound and struggling to find food. Celebrities, including New York’s mayors, gave donor-parties and brand-new delivery vans. Money poured in, two-thirds of it in private donations.

Food was part of that love, unconditional as a mother’s, given constantly and with pleasure by people who expected nothing back. No questions were asked when an order came in, but the meals, as irresistibly delicious as she insisted they had to be, were sent out at once. Never a day missed.

In 1987 a one-night fling with a Wall Street customer resulted in a daughter, Hedley, whom she kept close, though the father bolted. Single life was no joke, but New York, she concluded, was a hard place to find a man.
