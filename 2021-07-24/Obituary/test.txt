Or you might not. He had taken pains not to stand out, wearing drab clothes and carrying a faded mock-leather travel bag. The black-rimmed glasses, messy hair and stained teeth were his customary look. If he was smoking more than usual, and wiping more sweat, it was because in the bag, layered in newspaper, he had thousands of yuan in ten-yuan notes.

In 1988 the Communist regime, needing to rebuild the economy and shore up its state-owned enterprises, had decided in a limited way to let the public become investors. Bonds could be freely traded, at first, in only seven cities. But Shanghai and Hefei, two of the seven, were only a night’s train ride apart. And Mr Yang had learned, from intense scouring of local papers in the public library, that bonds priced at 94 yuan in relatively poor Anhui, where collective farmers were getting them as part of their wages, were selling at quite a bit more in Shanghai. Hence the travel-bag, containing (since he had no chequebook) a large wodge of his savings.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"figure","attribs":{"role":"presentation","itemtype":"https://schema.org/WPAdBlock"},"children":[]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"He was the first man in China to do long-distance bulk trading in government bonds, making a million yuan by it, his first “bucket of gold”.

He liked the old saying that the first man to suppose a crab might be edible was either very forward-looking or very hungry.

That morning he put his money into a single bond; in the afternoon he sold it at a profit of 800 yuan, or more than his annual salary. He was hooked. When in 1990 the government ordered trading to be done through two national stock exchanges, he sailed into the Shanghai securities market as if born to it. His first purchase was 2,000 shares in a maker of television tubes, bought for 100 yuan each and sold in six months for more than 800. Another bucket of gold.

If a warehouse-keeper with only an elementary education, living in a one-room flat, could make such a fortune in the markets, so could they. They hung on his advice, besieging him in the street and at his office door in lunch-breaks, clamouring for tips. He had plenty: “When the front of the exchange is full of bicycles, sell.” “The only money you really have is in your pocket.” “Hunt the bottom, avoid the top.” He wrote five books, gave lectures, and in 1993—when the Shanghai market got too frothy, and he prudently dumped his stock when the index hit 1,500, thereby missing the inevitable crash—was hired as a professor.

His big break in 1988 had come from a surprising change of policy. Another might come in the very next communiqué out of a plenary session of the Central Committee.

As a teenager, born in “new China” under the red flag, he had been a Red Guard, struggling gamely to enforce a traffic edict in Shanghai that revolutionary red meant “Go”, not “Stop”. Now he fretted that what he was doing, urging on the economy by buying cheap and selling dear, was profiteering and therefore a crime.

It was a socialist university of finance without walls; anyone could play it, learn from it and become as rich as he was, or richer.
