ONE INTRIGUING question about China is whether it can combine thuggish, autocratic politics with the predictable rules and property rights that entrepreneurs and capital markets need to thrive. The government’s recent attack on Didi Global, a Chinese ride-hailing firm that has just listed its shares in New York, suggests not. It is a warning to investors around the world—and to anyone hoping to make their fortune by setting up in China.

Didi is one of China’s superstar firms, with 493m users (more than Uber), 15m drivers and a presence in Brazil and Mexico. It listed its shares on June 30th, raising cash from global investors and valuing the firm at $68bn. Its prospectus contained 60 pages of “risk factors”, including a regulatory crackdown, that most investors snoozed over. But almost immediately one of them turned up.


It seems that Didi had pursued the listing against the wishes of the Cyberspace Administration of China. On July 4th the regulator struck back, saying that Didi had violated rules on collecting personal data, and banned it from mobile app stores in China. That sent Didi’s share price tumbling by over 20%. Marco Rubio, a hawkish American senator, said that it was “reckless” to allow Didi to float in New York.

China’s tech industry has been one of the most dynamic areas of the global economy in the past decade. Hundreds of large startups have yet to follow giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Didi by listing their shares. The intersection of e-commerce, payments and “super-apps” means that most daily transactions in China can take place on a smartphone. Global capital and talent have been critical to the industry’s rise. Didi has big foreign shareholders, including SoftBank and Uber, and owns a stake in Grab, a South-East Asian rival. Many of its top brass were educated at Western universities and have worked at American firms. Almost all the largest Chinese tech firms are listed in America or Hong Kong rather than the mainland. They have cosmopolitan executives and benefit from a flow of ideas across borders.

The crackdown began last year when Chinese regulators cancelled the $300bn flotation of Ant Group in Hong Kong and Shanghai at the last minute. The government went on to threaten other tech firms and to humble tycoons, not least Jack Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba and founder of Ant.

All governments worry about data privacy and monopolies, but China’s interventions signal a systematic attack on tech by the party. On July 7th Bloomberg reported that China might re-examine the use of “variable-interest entities”, a legal structure that underpins almost all foreign investment in Chinese tech. The message is clear: powerful tech firms must defer to the Communist Party, their bosses should keep quiet and foreign owners’ property rights can be violated.

An optimistic view is that the crackdown is political theatre. Global firms have often been burned in China only to recover. South Korean and Japanese companies have faced boycotts and protests that later faded away. China’s government shuns foreign banks for a while, to punish them for perceived errors, but eventually welcomes them back.

This time may be different. Foreign investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars, which may permanently alter the supply of global capital to China. To fill that hole, Chinese firms will depend on less sophisticated mainland markets. Once again entrepreneurs and investors must weigh and reweigh the vast rewards of China’s markets against the risks of its opaque laws, bullying officials and paranoid rulers. If you were risk-hungry, unorthodox and keen to start a business that breaks the mould, would you still choose to do so in China? ■

# 中国的共产党人控制了科技领域 

##### 对滴滴的攻击表明，共产党为控制权付出了多大的代价

关于中国的一个令人费解的问题是，它能否将暴徒式的专制政治与企业家和资本市场蓬勃发展所需的可预测规则和产权相结合。政府最近对刚刚在纽约上市的中国叫车公司Didi Global的攻击表明，它不能。这是对全世界投资者的一个警告，也是对任何希望通过在中国设立公司来发财的人的警告。

滴滴是中国的超级明星公司之一，拥有4.93亿用户（超过优步），1500万司机，并在巴西和墨西哥有业务。它于6月30日上市，从全球投资者那里筹集现金，对公司的估值为680亿美元。它的招股说明书包含了60页的 "风险因素"，包括监管部门的打击，大多数投资者对这些因素嗤之以鼻。但几乎立刻就有一个人出现了。


滴滴似乎违背了中国网络空间管理局的意愿，寻求上市。7月4日，监管机构进行了反击，称滴滴违反了收集个人数据的规定，并禁止其在中国的移动应用商店上市。这使得滴滴的股价暴跌了20%以上。美国鹰派参议员Marco Rubio表示，允许滴滴在纽约上市是 "鲁莽 "的行为。

过去十年，中国的科技行业一直是全球经济中最具活力的领域之一。数百家大型初创企业尚未跟随阿里巴巴、腾讯和滴滴等巨头上市。电子商务、支付和 "超级应用 "的交叉意味着中国的大多数日常交易可以在智能手机上进行。全球资本和人才对该行业的崛起至关重要。滴滴拥有大的外国股东，包括软银和Uber，并拥有东南亚竞争对手Grab的股份。滴滴的许多高层在西方大学接受教育，并曾在美国公司工作。几乎所有最大的中国科技公司都在美国或香港而不是大陆上市。他们拥有世界性的高管，并从跨国界的思想交流中受益。

打击行动始于去年，当时中国监管机构在最后一刻取消了蚂蚁金服集团在香港和上海的3000亿美元的浮动资金。政府继续威胁其他科技公司，并对大亨们进行羞辱，尤其是阿里巴巴的联合创始人和蚂蚁金服的创始人马云。

所有政府都担心数据隐私和垄断问题，但中国的干预措施表明该党对科技的系统攻击。7月7日，彭博社报道称，中国可能会重新审查 "可变利益实体 "的使用，这种法律结构几乎是所有外国投资中国科技的基础。信息很明确：强大的科技公司必须服从共产党，他们的老板应该保持沉默，外国业主的财产权可能会受到侵犯。

一种乐观的看法是，这次镇压是政治戏码。全球公司经常在中国被烧伤，但后来又恢复了。韩国和日本公司曾面临过抵制和抗议，但后来都消逝了。中国政府曾一度回避外国银行，以惩罚它们被认为的错误，但最终又欢迎它们回来。

这一次可能有所不同。外国投资者已经损失了数千亿美元，这可能会永久改变全球对中国的资本供应。为了填补这个漏洞，中国企业将依赖不太成熟的大陆市场。企业家和投资者必须再次权衡和重新衡量中国市场的巨大回报与中国不透明的法律、恃强凌弱的官员和偏执的统治者的风险。如果你渴望冒险，不走寻常路，热衷于开创一个打破常规的企业，你还会选择在中国这样做吗？
