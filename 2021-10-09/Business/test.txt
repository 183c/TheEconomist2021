A small number of sectors responsible for the bulk of listed companies’ emissions—power utilities, oil and gas firms, steel- and cement-makers—have a much harder challenge. As demand for carbon-intensive stuff collapses, they would have to find new ways to generate cashflows. Some are dabbling in renewables. Some see a future in low-carbon plastics and materials. But if they cannot turn these swiftly into huge sources of income, they would be better shutting down operations and returning cash to shareholders.
