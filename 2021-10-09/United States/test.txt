Strong stuff—which must have resonated with Mr Gottheimer’s many conservative constituents (he became in 2017 the first Democrat to win his New Jersey district since 1933). Yet it was inaccurate. The contents of the budget package are also Mr Biden’s agenda. Harnessing the two bills, as the president himself later acknowledged, has made it likelier that both will eventually pass. Moreover, far from aping the headbangers of the Republican Freedom Caucus, House left-wingers, led by Pramila Jayapal of Washington, have suggested they will make whatever compromise is necessary.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"At the outset of this process, the left demanded that the budget bill contain $6trn worth of largely unfunded tax cuts and spending. After moderates demurred, they came down to $3.5trn, paid for by tax rises and spread over a decade. Most Democrats were happy with that. But among a handful of holdouts, Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative and opponent of ambitious climate-change policy, said he could not countenance a package costing more than $1.5trn. Ms Jayapal suggested this week she would settle for $2.5trn, and Mr Manchin, an inveterate wheeler-dealer, that he “ruled nothing out.” Without underestimating the difficulties the party still faces in trying to push through its agenda, this looks less like a genuine crisis than the cut and thrust of legislating.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"That is something, as the infrastructure deal briefly recalled, that the parties used to engage in together. The idea was that by winning over a sufficient number of sensibles from the other side the governing party could render its own radicals irrelevant. The fact that the Democrats now have no option but to go it alone on climate change and other big problems that the do-nothing Republicans ignore has therefore given the party’s extremists a bigger say. Especially considering its tiny majorities: to pass the budget bill, the Democrats can afford to lose only three votes from their caucus in the House and none in the Senate.

Hence their periodic quarrelsomeness. Yet they have in recent years become less ideologically diverse, especially on economic policy, on which they have reached an interventionist consensus. Moderates and leftists still disagree—often wildly—about the details. Yet Mr Biden, the Democratic centre-of-gravity made flesh, has set parameters that both seem able to live within.

Even the most ardent left-wingers have therefore, in the end, proved willing to compromise. And the spectre of Mr Trump—whose rise Democrats often attribute to the failures of the governing system over many years—makes it even likelier that this pattern will endure. “We will get it done,” Ms Jayapal assured your columnist, when asked whether she would in any circumstance be willing to let the bills fail.
