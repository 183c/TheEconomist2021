IF PERCEPTION IS a construct of language, as an American anthropologist called Benjamin Lee Whorf argued, how Joe Biden’s party must rue the phrase “Democrats in disarray”. Ever since its first appearance, in local newspapers during the 1960s, journalists have reached for the alliterative term whenever Democrats have argued among themselves—whether existentially, as during their 1980s wilderness years; or in the normal course of hammering out a consensus among their many parts. Perusal of the New York Times website finds Democrats in deep disarray during the 1992 presidential primary, shortly before they nominated Bill Clinton, and straight after the 2006 mid-terms, at which they became the first party to control the House and Senate in over a decade.
Their recent performance on the Hill—to which the epithet has also been applied—might appear more deserving of it. After Senate Democrats struck an impressive bipartisan infrastructure deal, the party’s slightly bigger majority in the House failed to pass it. Left-wingers insisted the bill had to move in tandem with a partisan budget bill, containing trillions of dollars of climate and social-policy spending that had been making some moderates queasy. Together the bills represent most of Joe Biden’s domestic policy ambitions. Yet Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, was forced to set them aside.

For Representative Josh Gottheimer, this was a case of the “far left” of his party employing “Freedom Caucus tactics” to “destroy the president’s agenda”. Strong stuff—which must have resonated with Mr Gottheimer’s many conservative constituents (he became in 2017 the first Democrat to win his New Jersey district since 1933). Yet it was inaccurate. The contents of the budget package are also Mr Biden’s agenda. Harnessing the two bills, as the president himself later acknowledged, has made it likelier that both will eventually pass. Moreover, far from aping the headbangers of the Republican Freedom Caucus, House left-wingers, led by Pramila Jayapal of Washington, have suggested they will make whatever compromise is necessary.
At the outset of this process, the left demanded that the budget bill contain $6trn worth of largely unfunded tax cuts and spending. After moderates demurred, they came down to $3.5trn, paid for by tax rises and spread over a decade. Most Democrats were happy with that. But among a handful of holdouts, Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative and opponent of ambitious climate-change policy, said he could not countenance a package costing more than $1.5trn. Ms Jayapal suggested this week she would settle for $2.5trn, and Mr Manchin, an inveterate wheeler-dealer, that he “ruled nothing out.” Without underestimating the difficulties the party still faces in trying to push through its agenda, this looks less like a genuine crisis than the cut and thrust of legislating.
That is something, as the infrastructure deal briefly recalled, that the parties used to engage in together. The idea was that by winning over a sufficient number of sensibles from the other side the governing party could render its own radicals irrelevant. The fact that the Democrats now have no option but to go it alone on climate change and other big problems that the do-nothing Republicans ignore has therefore given the party’s extremists a bigger say. Especially considering its tiny majorities: to pass the budget bill, the Democrats can afford to lose only three votes from their caucus in the House and none in the Senate. Yet the intra-party wrestling this has occasioned is distracting from another big change. The Democrats are for the most part unanimous.
According to score-keeping by the website FiveThirtyEight, House Democrats are the most unified caucus of the past three Congresses; 203 of their 223 members have voted with Mr Biden 100% of the time. So, for that matter, has Mr Manchin. There are a few reasons for this strange togetherness.
Lacking a central creed—of the sort that Republicans once found in conservatism and now find in Donald Trump—the Democrats are more a collaboration of interest groups. Hence their periodic quarrelsomeness. Yet they have in recent years become less ideologically diverse, especially on economic policy, on which they have reached an interventionist consensus. Moderates and leftists still disagree—often wildly—about the details. Yet Mr Biden, the Democratic centre-of-gravity made flesh, has set parameters that both seem able to live within. During last year’s primary, left-wingers spoke of abolishing private health insurance. Their current wrangle with Mr Manchin over renewable-power incentives seems constrained by comparison.
That is less a testament to Mr Biden’s authority (which has been tested in recent weeks, as his ratings have plummeted) than the fact that all Democrats are keen to govern. The party’s base expects them to; no Democrat has been elected on a promise to torpedo its agenda as members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus were. Even the most ardent left-wingers have therefore, in the end, proved willing to compromise. And the spectre of Mr Trump—whose rise Democrats often attribute to the failures of the governing system over many years—makes it even likelier that this pattern will endure. “We will get it done,” Ms Jayapal assured your columnist, when asked whether she would in any circumstance be willing to let the bills fail. Even with such little margin for slippage, that still seems the likeliest outcome.
The wages of governing
Whether such a victory would improve Mr Biden’s miserable ratings is another matter entirely. Among the many depressing truths lurking in political-science books is the fact that voters mostly ignore a government’s legislative record. Elections are decided by tribal emotions and fundamentals, not by child-tax credits. The increasingly tribal Republicans—who released no manifesto ahead of the last election—have taken that on board. By comparison, it is good that the Democrats are still overlooking it. ■
