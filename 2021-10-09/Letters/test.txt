It is something of a trope in Arabic linguistics that every Arab thinks their dialect is the closest to MSA. And, in a way, they are all right. Tunisians can point to the fact that they preserve almost all the standard Arabic consonants, though their love of consonant clusters makes their speech sound very different. Some desert Bedouins can boast that they maintain grammatical distinctions that disappeared from other spoken varieties long ago. Egyptians note that the non-standard G for J in their dialect is actually the most ancient form.

This edited collection identifies governmental repression as the primary obstacle to improving education in Arab countries and suggests various liberalising reforms.
