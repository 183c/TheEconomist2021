And rarely had the rituals of small-town baseball—back after an 18-month, covid-enforced hiatus—felt more welcome. Children with cotton candy and mitts raced around the concourse. Neighbours and workmates hailed each other, relaxed and mostly maskless, as they queued for pizza and beers.

Since the evolution of the farm system in the 1920s, the minors have had little or no control over their squads, which their major-league patron recruits, pays and treats as feeder-stock. In a normal year, two-thirds of a minor-league team may be new, and it is liable to be raided by its patron during the season. Any minor leaguer good enough to be embraced by the fans is almost by definition halfway out the door. The same is true for a local ballpark’s announcers and entertainers. Paradoxically, this makes one of the most locally rooted institutions in American sport—the small-town ball club where local couples court each other, entertain their children and advertise their businesses—also one of the most transient.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"With forbearance on both sides, this has been a fruitful tension. Major League Baseball, the game’s monopolistic overseer, has suffered the inefficiencies of a diffuse system for its talent-pool. Minor-league fans have forgone a deep relationship with their teams for the thrill of a prestigious connection to the majors and high-quality baseball—often in places, such as Clinton, Iowa, or Niles, Ohio, with little else to boast of. But MLB has upset this balance. Teams like the Keys are emerging from covid-induced calamity—the scrapping of a season and over 40m prospective ticket sales—to the most traumatic shake-up of the minors in decades.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"On the expiry of a pre-existing operating agreement late last year, MLB cut its roster of minor-league affiliates by 42, hardened its grip on the remaining 120, and in the process scrapped several historic leagues, such as the Ohio-based International League (founded in 1884). Advances in talent-spotting had reduced its need for a large reserve. The Keys, for 30 years a farm team of the Baltimore Orioles, is among the teams that have lost out.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"This change was also covid-related. When MLB first proposed its plans, in late 2019, they met high-level pushback. Over a hundred House members backed a bipartisan “Save Minor League Baseball” task-force. A related Senate resolution united both Republican senators from Iowa—which stood to lose three minor-league teams, including the Clinton LumberKings—with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose states stood to lose one each. MLB’s chances of getting its way looked dicey. But the pandemic diverted political attention and the cancellation of the minors’ season made it hard for them to get it back. MLB ended up getting everything it wanted.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Its 30 franchisees are not the only beneficiaries. Player salaries in the minors have been increased (from a pitifully low base). Travel distances have been reduced. To its credit, MLB has meanwhile helped most of the teams it dropped find another league. The Keys and its recent opponents, the West Virginia Black Bears, are among half a dozen that have formed a new league to showcase top college players ahead of the MLB draft in July. It should also be said that, while the diehards in Section 107 were livid at being junked by the Orioles, few other Keys fans seemed to care. Most minor-league watchers, having little connection to the players, come along for some baseball-themed fun. “It’s a great place to bring the kids, but I couldn’t say who’s playing,” said Dan, a regular attendee, sitting with his brother Leel, a thickly-bearded trucker.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Nonetheless, MLB has dealt a heavy blow to baseball’s regional infrastructure and traditions. Four of the affected teams have ceased operations—including another in western Maryland, the Hagerstown Suns. More will follow.

Of the 202 teams that have played in independent leagues over the past 30 years, almost half failed within four years.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"h2","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"In a minor key","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"This is a gloomy development, and not only for baseball fans.
