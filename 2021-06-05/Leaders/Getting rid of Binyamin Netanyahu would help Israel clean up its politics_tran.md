NEVER BEFORE has ’s hold on the premiership of Israel looked so weak. On June 2nd his opponents, led by Naftali Bennett (pictured) and Yair Lapid, agreed to form a government that excludes the man who has dominated his country’s politics for the past 12 years. The only thing left is for the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) to hold a confidence vote. Mr Netanyahu will do his utmost to sabotage it. But if he fails, his long reign will be over.
“King Bibi” has overseen a flourishing high-tech economy and one of the world’s best covid-19 vaccination campaigns. He has made peace with several Arab states and kept Israel safe, notwithstanding a recent war in Gaza. Many of his policies are now generally accepted, even by the politicians pushing him out.

Yet he also sowed division, mixing nationalism, chauvinism and resentment of elites in order to win elections. He clung to power even after being charged with corruption. And when threatened he has lashed out at anyone in his way. The press, the judiciary, the police—all were part of a “witch hunt” aimed at bringing him down, he said.
If Mr Netanyahu stays, it will drag a weary electorate to the polls for a fifth time since 2019. If he goes, it may help heal Israeli politics. True, his Likud party is still the largest in the Knesset, and his nationalist and religious base remains an electoral force. But he has been a uniquely talented demagogue, eloquent and ruthless in equal measure. Though he will remain on the scene (and surely plot his revenge), his removal from the top job makes the political mood in Israel a little less toxic. Moreover, his prosecution and political comeuppance are proof that Israel’s institutions have held firm in the face of his assault.
Mr Netanyahu, though, has shown up Israel’s vulnerabilities. The next government must fix them. That will not be easy, as the parties in the coalition do not agree on much. Wisely, Mr Bennett, who would become prime minister, has set expectations low. “We will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible,” he says. A budget is a priority, since Israel has not had one in two years. But the new team should also focus on governance—and start by closing the loophole that lets a person under indictment serve as prime minister.
Other steps might include depoliticising the police, whose aggressive tactics helped spark riots inside Israel that culminated in Palestinians firing rockets into Israel from Gaza. Splitting the job of attorney-general, so that one person is not both chief prosecutor and legal counsel to the government, is another good idea. At some point a conversation should be had about the Supreme Court, which has great power and little accountability.
Reforms will be difficult. But tackling any of these problems would have been impossible under Mr Netanyahu, who used the legal system as a bogeyman. His reliance on the ultra-Orthodox also meant that civil marriage remains illegal and public services closed on the Sabbath, although most Israelis favour liberalising such things.
The new coalition includes an Arab party, but little progress is likely with the Palestinians. Still, small steps are possible, such as increasing funding in Arab parts of Israel and alleviating the suffering in the occupied territories and in Gaza. “Everyone will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams,” says Mr Bennett, an ardent supporter of the settler movement. A government grounded in reality? That doesn’t sound so bad. ■
