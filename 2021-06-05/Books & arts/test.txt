Using these as a proxy for settlement, Mr Blevins regards colonisation of the West as a result of big government rather than rugged individualism.

To keep up with migration patterns, postal services were grafted onto existing businesses.

Until 1971 the postal service was a cabinet-level department in the executive branch, and jobs within it were doled out as patronage. Of the 80,000 appointments submitted to the Senate for approval between 1829 and 1917, nearly 62,000 were for post-office jobs. The facilities themselves were often turned into de facto campaign headquarters where partisans wooed voters. Congressmen were frequently caught up in rows over who should be postmasters in their districts.
