Beautiful World, Where Are You. By Sally Rooney. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 368 pages; $28. Faber; £16.99
“NOTHING ODD will do long,” said Samuel Johnson of Laurence Sterne’s digressive novel “Tristram Shandy”. This verdict was misguided on two counts. “Tristram Shandy”is now regarded as one of the great achievements of 18th-century literature; meanwhile the novel, then in its infancy, developed into a form that teems with oddity. It is a repository of peculiar characters, settings and situations, flights of idiosyncratic language and jags of startling perception.

By contrast, as their titles suggest, “Conversations with Friends” and “Normal People”, Sally Rooney’s first two books, focused on everyday aspects of life—friendship, romance, growing up—which they chronicled in limpid but unflashy prose. Both were acclaimed by critics, became bestsellers and have been adapted for television. In Ms Rooney’s stories, normality is not merely her subject matter. It is also a virtue to be cultivated, perhaps even the key to happiness. “He’s quite normal,” says one character of another’s religious faith in the Irish author’s third novel; “he won’t try to convert you or anything.”
The outline of “Beautiful World, Where Are You” will seem familiar to readers of its predecessors. Alice, a successful but troubled novelist, has moved to the Irish coast where she meets Felix, a warehouse worker. Her best friend Eileen, dismally house-sharing in Dublin, is tortured by her infatuation with Simon, whom she has known since childhood.
The story vibrates to their romantic havering. But compared with the work of Jane Austen—which Ms Rooney admires, and in which courtship drives the plot and the climax is marriage—her tales of messy modern love follow improvised patterns. Sex, which she describes unsqueamishly and arrestingly, is a beginning not a destination, and tends to lead to an enervating stasis (male domination and female masochism crop up frequently). Relationships meander in a state of quantum irresolution, the parties likely to have different perceptions of whether they are off or on.
In “Normal People” especially, Ms Rooney (who is still only 30) combined simplicity with sparkle. But her new book pushes her devotion to ordinariness to its logical extreme. She favours bland adjectives, such as “little”, “clear” and “thin”. When Alice and Felix visit Rome, which may well contain the most impressive collection of objets d’art in the world, the reader is told peremptorily that “Felix spent the morning wandering around the city looking at things”. Intellectually as well as stylistically, the tone is flat. Much of the book is given over to long, discursive email exchanges between Alice and Eileen, in which they observe that market capitalism is at odds with traditional conservatism, that plastic tat is ugly, and that the fall of the Soviet Union was momentous.
Ms Rooney, an avowed Marxist, has implied in interviews that these views reflect her own. The problem is not that the ideas are right or wrong, but that they are predictable. The exchanges lack dialectical fizz as Alice and Eileen generally agree with one another. That may be because both are projections of paths Ms Rooney herself has followed, or might have: Alice, a bestselling novelist who is struggling with the ambush of early, unexpected fame; Eileen, the thwarted writer too timorous to put pen to paper.
The novel’s most interesting feature is its handling of the church. Typically, fiction uses the clash between religious belief and the secular world to torment its characters. Here Ms Rooney presents religion as a possible solution. Simon sees no conflict between his Catholicism and his vigorous and varied sex life. Alice and Eileen, non-believers both, are drawn to the consolations of Christianity. Remembering the first occasion she slept with Simon, Eileen thinks that “it would have been a nice life for me if he had done the Christian thing and asked me to marry him.” Alice admires the “consistency” of Catholic doctrine, in which “beauty, truth and goodness” inhere in God.
More than in her previous books, in “Beautiful World, Where Are You” Ms Rooney’s political preoccupations have interfered with her craft. But a religious instinct seems also to loom behind her restrained prose, her aversion to vividness, her tendency to blur feelings and perceptions with qualifiers (“vaguely” is one of her favourite words), and a marked new reluctance to enter her characters’ minds. The mix of asceticism and mysticism suggests an author who thinks the real action is happening in another realm. Whether her devoted readers are happy to live with the consequences may be a matter of faith. ■
