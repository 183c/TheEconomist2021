Stop monkeying around
You urged Western countries to increase neurological experimentation on primates to keep pace with China and Japan, arguing that brain diseases are becoming a leading human killer and monkey brains closely resemble our own (“”, July 24th). Non-human primates, from chimpanzees and gorillas to marmosets and macaques, all share many exquisite mental faculties with humans. Indeed, this is what makes non-human primates attractive to researchers. However, implanting machinery in their brains remains an undeniably brutal procedure that causes them to suffer immensely, as would humans.

You said that Western countries will inevitably have to choose between accepting therapies produced from non-human primate brain experiments or rejecting them on principle. This is not a new problem, and the argument shortchanges ethical alternative methods that show promise of being superior to animal experiments. Moreover, the scientific literature is replete with duplicate and non-reproducible primate-brain studies that suggest the value of these experiments is less than the animal-research community claims.
The important lesson will not be expressed in the firing neurons of tortured monkeys, but in finding ways to advance human health while also respecting the lives and rights of non-human primates.

The United States actually does have a large colony of free-ranging macaques on the small and uninhabited Morgan Island off the coast of South Carolina. Known as Monkey Island to locals, its furry residents can be seen playing on the beach and swinging through dense foliage. The 4,000 or so breeding macaques originally came from Puerto Rico, where they arrived as stowaways from India.
Recognising the need for a reliable source of primate specimens, the federal government rounded them up and deposited them on an island offered by South Carolina. The secretive place is closely patrolled by the coast guard, but the monkeys have the run of the land, free from all but occasional human interference to deposit food, and the removal of some specimens to the mainland for testing.

Race relations in Singapore
Readers of “” (July 31st) would not have guessed that Singapore was born as an independent country precisely because its leaders refused to countenance a political arrangement based on the dominance of one race. Having separated from Malay-majority Malaysia in 1965, the easiest path for Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues would have been to base their political legitimacy on the Chinese majority in Singapore. Rather, against the odds and with great courage, they insisted on building a multiracial polity.
They chose English as the main language of government and education instead of Chinese. They gave every race, religion and language-group free scope to develop their heritages and cultures. Rather than enforce majority-Chinese dominance, they protected the rights of minorities. A Presidential Council of Minority Rights was empowered to veto any legislation that discriminated against any racial or religious community.
At present, seven out of 20 cabinet ministers are minorities, as are the chief justice and nine out of 33 judges on the Supreme Court. Malays, Indians and Eurasians have occupied senior positions in all three branches of government, including in the armed and security forces.
Our multiracial harmony remains a work in progress. As in many other multiracial societies, it is harder to be a racial minority in Singapore than a member of the majority race, and there remain group differences in social and economic achievement between ethnic groups. But all have progressed substantially year after year.
By working unremittingly on our multiracial harmony, we have avoided the racial and religious strife that have troubled many other post-colonial nations, and for that matter, America and Britain too.

Meritocracy at work
As showed (August 7th), fair university admissions and two decades of school reforms are pointing Britain in a meritocratic direction, but we have some way to go. By the time disadvantaged students apply to university, it is often too late. This is crucial in mathematics, where a proven high capability is essential for science, technology and engineering degrees.
Universities are taking matters into their own hands. Cambridge, Imperial, King’s, Durham and Exeter are among the universities founding mathematics schools, each educating hundreds of disadvantaged sixth-formers. But, as with Oxford's foundation year, scalability is limited. We can lean harder on technology. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), like those from Imperial on EdX, provide resources for students aspiring to the highest A-level mathematics grades. They can see, and build towards, the standards of elite universities.
A happy by-product, consumer surplus, even, is that many outside Britain are taking these free courses, including in low- and middle-income countries. For students, it raises ambitions. For talent-hungry universities, it’s enlightened self-interest.

Demonyms
Surely the inhabitants of Kazakhstan are Kazakhs, rather than the clunky “Kazakhstanis” (“”, July 24th)? The “stan” suffix in the name of an Asian country is roughly equivalent to the “land” suffix in the name of a European country. Hence we refer to the Dutch, English, Finns, Irish, Polish and Swiss, and also to the Thais in Asia. We don’t call Icelanders the Iceish, but there is an exception to every rule.

The fall of man
Your play on St John’s Gospel—“who can say what new flesh the designers’ words will eventually bring into being?” (“”, July 31st)—was an unsettling commentary on how science now thinks it is divine. Jon Stewart had a point when, speculating on the origin of covid-19, he said:“Here’s how I believe the world ends…The last words man utters are somewhere in a lab, a guy goes, ‘Huh, it worked!’”

Can you feel the upbeat?
Reviewing quarterly earnings at Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, the chief executive, “sounded upbeat”, you reported (“”, July 17th). Was that because Goldman’s business is flourishing? Or was it that Mr Solomon was getting cued up for his other job, moonlighting as DJ D-Sol? With tracks like “Don’t Stop”, “Feel Alive”, and “Electric”, it is safe to assume Mr Solomon channels his inner crowd-pleaser in the boardroom as well as on the dance floor.
