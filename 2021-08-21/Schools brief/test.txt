Sometimes the finding is done directly by the sperm—fern’s sperm swim from the antheridia in which they form, through films of water, in search of the egg-bearing archegonia of other gametophytes.

It makes sense to collaborate with a close relative in child rearing because their children will carry some of your genes, but it can also make sense if the adults are not related, especially in situations where favours are reciprocated.
