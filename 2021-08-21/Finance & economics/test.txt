Alfred Marshall, writing in 1873, hoped that education would help erase the “distinction between working men and gentlemen”. Gary Becker of the University of Chicago reimagined education as an investment in “human capital” that would earn a return in the market much like other assets.

What matters is not only how much you have, but whether you have more than the next person. For many students it is not enough merely to acquire a good education.
