DESPITE THEIR reputation for thriving in a crisis, City solicitors were having an uncomfortable time of it in early 2020. As the pandemic started, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), the driving force behind much of the financial sector’s legal activity, looked likely to grind to a halt. British law firms froze salaries and deferred bonuses; meanwhile, their American counterparts cut pay cheques by as much as 25% across the globe. Except for those departments that expected to benefit from corporate insolvencies, hiring stuttered to a halt.
But far from disaster, the pandemic proved a lawyers’ bonanza. Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the world’s highest-grossing law firm since 2017, made a record-breaking $4.8bn (£3.5bn) in 2020. Several big American firms are offering newly qualified associates in their London offices salaries of £140,000 ($194,000). Other City firms announced bumper year-end bonuses for junior staff, on top of payouts in the autumn intended to compensate for a frantic period of pandemic-driven work. Why were the predictions so wrong?

One reason was that lockdowns prompted central banks to slash interest rates and ramp up quantitative easing (creating money to buy financial assets), thus propping up markets. Deals that had seemed off the table were promptly put back on. By the end of 2020, acquisitions had fallen by just 5% compared with the previous year; in the first half of 2021 they hit an all-time high. One type of acquirer proved a particular boon for legal advisers. “Law firms that have become close to the bigger private-equity funds and their lenders have got an absolutely astonishing volume of work,” says a partner at one large American law firm.
City law firms also benefited from a long-term trend towards more complex deals. Private-equity deals, in particular, often involve short timelines and intricate corporate structures and tax arrangements. Having a legal adviser who is already familiar with the way a particular fund works can make the difference between closing an acquisition or not. The record $1.9trn of unspent capital that private-equity investors are sitting on translates into enviable pricing power for their lawyers.
More generally, the thicket of regulation surrounding transactions has become even more impenetrable. Rules concerning tax, competition and corporate governance generate ever more paperwork. The shift in the political weather from globalisation to protectionism has made foreign direct investment more complicated, and governments have granted themselves greater powers to veto deals. It all means more work for lawyers specialising in cross-border M&amp;A—and clients who are willing to pay whatever it takes to ensure that deals go ahead.
While top American firms stuff their associates’ mouths with gold, their British competitors are lagging behind. The most generous offer newly qualified lawyers a relatively miserly £100,000 a year. This pay gap is long-standing, since British firms have always lured new associates with promises of (slightly) less gruelling working hours and greater intellectual cachet. Should it widen further, however, junior City lawyers may soon be striking new deals of their own. ■
