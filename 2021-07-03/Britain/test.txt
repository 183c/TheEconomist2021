He is close to his party’s power-brokers, in particular Rishi Sunak, who was his former protégé as chief secretary to the Treasury, and Mr Hunt, with whom he worked when he was community secretary with some responsibility for care homes and Mr Hunt was health secretary.

With Mr Javid available on the backbenches, the prime minister went some way towards remedying his cabinet’s tendency towards the lightweight.

He must find a replacement for Sir Simon Stevens, the long-serving chief executive of the National Health Service, who has said he plans to step down.
