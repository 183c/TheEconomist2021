Many of the long-distance runners at the Tokyo Olympics, which begin on July 23rd, will arrive at the starting line sporting footwear with a distinctive chunky-looking heel.

The new shoes offer such a big performance advantage that critics have described them as “technological doping”.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Running-shoe makers have long tried to boost athletic performance, observes Geoff Burns, a biomechanics expert at the University of Michigan.

In practice, as Dr Burns observes, it wouldn’t quite do that. A marathon improvement of around 90 seconds would be a more realistic expectation. But Vaporfly and its successors have helped athletes smash a string of records. On June 6th Sifan Hassan, a Dutch runner, completed a women’s 10,000 metres race in 29 minutes and 6.82 seconds, beating a record set in 2016. Two days later she was overtaken by Letesenbet Gidey, an Ethiopian, who clocked 29 minutes and 1.03 seconds. In 2019 Eliod Kipchoge, a Kenyan, became the first to run, albeit in an unofficial event, a marathon’s distance of 42.195km in under two hours. The same weekend Brigid Kosgei, another Kenyan, broke a women’s marathon record that had stood for 16 years.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Scientists are still puzzling over exactly how the shoes work. The soles are made of a new type of foam that offers an unprecedented mix of resilience and squidginess, according to Dr Burns. This returns around 80% of the energy from each strike of a runner’s foot. The carbon-fibre plate may help by stiffening the midsole, and possibly by altering a runner’s gait. By cushioning a runner’s bones, muscles and ligaments from repetitive impacts, the shoes may even help athletes train harder than they otherwise could.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"All that is great news for Nike, which sells the Vaporfly and its successors for around $250 each.
