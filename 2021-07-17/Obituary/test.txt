But Auschwitz had several orchestras, playing or rehearsing for up to ten hours a day. And for 18-year-old Esther Loewy, as she then was, the just-formed Girls’ Orchestra was a piece of luck. If she could get into it she would not be hauling rocks all day, which might kill her. She would be given more food.

That was more her kind of thing, like the Bach, Mozart and Schubert she sang on request for the barrack leaders: the music of her childhood in Saarbrücken, where their house rang with family recitals and the rich operatic voice of her father, a cantor in the synagogue. But that was in another world. In this one she played with a rifle aimed at her back; the power of music was used as a lure and a lie, a promise of comfort where there was none. The worst was when they performed at the railway station as the fetid cattle cars arrived. The dazed new arrivals would smile and wave, with no idea what was waiting for them.
