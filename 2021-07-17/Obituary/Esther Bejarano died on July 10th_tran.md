THE THOUGHT of an orchestra in Auschwitz chills the blood. The idea that at the end of those railway tracks, through those high iron gates, amid the pall and ash from the ever-burning crematoriums, light music was playing, is an obscenity. But Auschwitz had several orchestras, playing or rehearsing for up to ten hours a day. And for 18-year-old Esther Loewy, as she then was, the just-formed Girls’ Orchestra was a piece of luck. If she could get into it she would not be hauling rocks all day, which might kill her. She would be given more food. So before her audition she sat in a corner of her barracks, a tiny, drab figure with her chafed hands and shaved head, practising.
The piece she had been set was easy, the hit song from the film “Bel Ami”, which was also all about luck. “You have luck with the women, Bel Ami!” it ran: Du hast Glück bei den Frau’n, Bel Ami! Everyone knew that jaunty tune. What she did not know was how to play the heavy accordion that rested on her knees. She had lied that she did, just to get in. As a pianist she could work out the right-hand keys, but all those left-hand buttons foxed her. What did they mean? This was urgent; without music, she was finished. Then she chanced on a chord of C major, like an old friend, and all was well. Her luck was in.

It was hardly a rest cure. Her morning task now was to stand in all weathers at the camp gate, playing German marching songs as the prisoners went off to forced labour and, in the evening, trudged back. The same old tunes, over and over. In the evenings there were classical concerts, tailored to the few instruments they had and whatever sheet music they could get. That was more her kind of thing, like the Bach, Mozart and Schubert she sang on request for the barrack leaders: the music of her childhood in Saarbrücken, where their house rang with family recitals and the rich operatic voice of her father, a cantor in the synagogue. But that was in another world. In this one she played with a rifle aimed at her back; the power of music was used as a lure and a lie, a promise of comfort where there was none. The worst was when they performed at the railway station as the fetid cattle cars arrived. The dazed new arrivals would smile and wave, with no idea what was waiting for them. She would cry, then, as she played.
Yet even through such scenes, luck glinted sometimes. When she caught typhoid, her role as the only accordionist got her proper care. After less than a year in Auschwitz her status as mischling, mixed-race, with a Christian grandmother, saw her moved to Ravensbrück, a women’s camp that was slightly less harsh. When, in 1945, the prisoners were marched west to escape Soviet forces, she and six other girls ran away into the forest. There they fell in with American troops; safe now, she slowly made her way to France and, eventually, Palestine. She had survived.
The war was over. Her own fight, though, was just beginning, against racism and anti-Semitism everywhere. The young Esther, singing and playing timorously in Auschwitz, might have been astonished to see herself seven decades later in a pixie haircut and long scarf, dancing on a stage with rappers. But so she did, this time making music vigorous and defiant enough to avenge those hopeless faces at the railway station, and all who had died.
The post-war world had severely disappointed her. She settled and married in the new state of Israel, where she found success as a singer, but Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians made her wild with anger. It struck her as racism pure and simple, a forced displacement and oppression of people as unjust as the persecution of Europe’s Jews. She attacked those policies all her life long, so furiously that she was later called an anti-Semite herself, and evidently Israel was not the place to stay.
She took the family to Germany. It was home, though full of awful memories. The day when, at 14, she had been kicked out of school; the time Hitler had visited Saarbrücken, with the crowds eerily saluting him; the beating of her sister Ruth on Kristallnacht in 1938, until she could hardly stand; Ruth’s killing, and her parents’ murder. She could hope, at least, that after Germany’s defeat Nazism would disappear. When the Americans had rescued her, she had played the accordion while Hitler’s portrait blazed fiercely in a fire. Surely his vile ideas were now as dead as he was.
They were still around, however. They lurked like bad seeds underground, or like her recurring nightmare of Nazi boots trampling her—just as, on the forced march from Ravensbrück, the soldiers had shot and stamped over the bodies of those too weak to go on. In 1986, at 61, she got into an argument with members of the fascist NPD and their police protectors, right outside her boutique in Hamburg. When both groups insulted her, it was time to write her memoirs of the camps and to co-found the Auschwitz Committee, which helped survivors tell their stories. It was time, too, to unleash her music against what she called the Great Silence.
Her father had collected Yiddish songs. Now she formed a band, called Coincidence, with her children Joram and Edna, to sing more recent melodies from the Jewish resistance. Her favourite was “Mir Lebn Eybik”, “We’ll live for ever”, a song from the Vilnius ghetto: “We’ll live for ever,/though worlds burn down,/We’ll live for ever,/no cash around.../We will live on and on and on.../We’ll live for ever,/We are here!”
That certainly seemed true of her, as she toured tirelessly round Germany. Every week she was in a different city, especially in schools, telling the children what had happened to the Jews, alerting them to racism in all its forms. To modernise the message she embraced the hip-hop of Microphone Mafia, two towering young men, one a Turkish immigrant, who rapped on the resistance songs (a bit loudly, she thought), while she, the tiny, lucky survivor with fists clenched, kept the old words flowing.
She also sang “Bel Ami”. Usually it was a defiant, happy song without an accordion, which she did not play onstage. If anyone else played accordion for her, it became harder to sing, as though her voice waded through tears. ■
