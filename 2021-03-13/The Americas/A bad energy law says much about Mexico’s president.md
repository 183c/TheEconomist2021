# A bad energy law says much about Mexico’s president

WITH THE pandemic raging and the economy in a slump, Mexico’s Congress found time to discuss a new electricity law at the behest of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Approved on March 3rd, it will make electricity more expensive, dirtier and less reliable. It has thrown into doubt the value of some $26bn of private investment in wind and solar energy, mainly by foreign companies. That Mr López Obrador (or AMLO for short) sets so much store by such a bad law says much about what is wrong with his vision for his country.

Until the 1990s electricity was a state monopoly in Mexico, mainly in the hands of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE). A timid opening to the private sector, begun in the 1990s, gathered force with an energy reform by the government of Enrique Peña Nieto in 2014. This allowed private investment in oil and gas as well as electricity generation. It established a wholesale electricity market. A regulatory commission set rules under which the cheapest and greenest providers of power would get priority in selling to the grid.


AMLO’s law reverses that. It gives priority to CFE’s power, much of which comes from ageing thermal plants running on polluting fuel oil. The CFE’s generating costs are about 25% higher than those of solar or wind plants. It is not clear whether wind and solar plants will still be able to operate. “We don’t know who will set the price,” says Montserrat Ramiro, a former member of the now-moribund regulatory commission. The CFE can’t meet peak energy demand alone, so blackouts are likely. AMLO says the price Mexicans pay for their electricity will not go up, so the government will presumably subsidise the increased cost.

Why has he pushed this measure? The new law states that CFE was “broken and ruined” by the 2014 reform, which the government claims discriminated in favour of private operators who in some cases gained contracts “by fraud”. Putting the interests of CFE ahead of those of Mexicans seems to be the work of the company’s boss, Manuel Bartlett. Aged 85, Mr Bartlett is an old-fashioned statist and was a pillar of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ran Mexico in authoritarian fashion from the 1920s to 2000.

AMLO had not previously shown much interest in electricity. But one of his obsessions is to boost Pemex, the state oil and gas company. He wants Mexico to be self-sufficient in fuels. He has pushed Pemex to step up refining (and is building a new $8bn refinery in Tabasco, his home state). But the company’s ancient refineries throw off a lot of high-sulphur fuel oil which, under new international rules imposed in 2020, can no longer be used by most ships. CFE is now its only big customer for this gunge.

The government rushed through the law after the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional its attempt to roll back the 2014 electricity reform through regulations. Whether the court strikes down the law, too, will be a test of its independence. Investors are likely to invoke dispute-settlement mechanisms in Mexico’s trade agreements with the United States, the European Union and Asian countries.

The president will not pay a political cost for all this in the short term. Lax monetary policy in the United States prompts investors to buy Mexican government bonds, keeping the peso broadly stable and removing a constraint on AMLO, argues Luis de la Calle, an economist in Mexico City.

And the president has forged a quasi-religious tie with many of his supporters. He poses as a moral crusader against the “pillaging” of Mexico in “the neoliberal period” (there was indeed much corruption under Mr Peña). Such rhetoric is popular. Polls show that some 60-65% of people approve of AMLO, even though most think his government is failing on the pandemic, security and the economy. He is likely to retain his congressional majority at a mid-term election in June. Should he increase it, he may overturn the energy reform of 2014 altogether.

With the American economy recovering and companies looking to move plants from China, Mexico has much going for it. To capitalise, it needs reliable energy, better technology and the rule of law. Investment is now the lowest it has been as a percentage of GDP since 1995. By tearing up the rules, and casting doubt on power supplies, the new law may depress it further. “Mexico is no longer an interesting place for private investment in anything,” says Andrés Rozental, a former diplomat. Eventually Mexicans will come to regret that.
