IT WILL BE a more fitting home for a rising superpower than the delegation’s current poky premises in Marylebone. Overlooking the Tower of London, the fine Georgian buildings of the old Royal Mint, where Britain’s coins and medals were once struck, are to become the new Chinese embassy. Plans lodged with the local council outline a vast complex designed by David Chipperfield, the architect behind the renovated Neues Museum in Berlin, which includes 230 flats. Announcing the new base in 2018, Liu Xiaoming, the then ambassador, declared it to be a “fresh golden fruit” of a new “golden era” of ties.

That followed the era of David Cameron, who wanted Britain to be China’s “best partner in the West”. Today, exchanges are more steely than golden. Under Boris Johnson, Britain’s stance has hardened dramatically, and now hews more closely to America’s. “What has really surprised me is the speed of the degeneration between the two countries,” says Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a think-tank.


The shift has shown up in several recent disputes. A rebellion by hawkish MPs over the trade bill has led the government to offer a compromise that would allow lawmakers greater scrutiny of the human-rights record of Britain’s trading partners. The Sino-sceptic coalition in Parliament is broad. Tom Tugendhat, a leading China critic, is the liberal Tory chairman of the foreign affairs committee; Iain Duncan Smith, another, is a Brexit hardliner.

On February 4th, Ofcom, Britain’s broadcasting regulator, said it would revoke the licence of CGTN, an international TV channel owned by China’s state broadcaster. Ofcom found that Star China Media Limited, the licence-holder, did not have editorial control over its output; permission to switch the licence to a new entity was refused after Ofcom concluded it would be “ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party”, violating rules shielding broadcasters from political control. The channel had previously been rebuked by Ofcom for broadcasting the alleged forced confession of a British prisoner in China, and for lopsided coverage of Hong Kong’s democracy movement.

That movement has the British government’s ear. On January 31st, in response to tightening Chinese control in the former British colony, the government opened a new visa scheme granting 2.9m Hong Kongers and their dependents the opportunity to settle in Britain. Conservative MPs were delighted. The government reckons as many as 322,000 people will take up the scheme over five years; London may become a new hub for Hong Kong dissidents.

For a decade, British intelligence has known that the country is vulnerable to Chinese espionage. Those fears were sidelined in the “golden era”. No longer. It emerged on February 4th that three Chinese spies allegedly posing as journalists had been expelled. Academics working on sensitive technology in co-operation with China have been warned that they risk prosecution for breaching export-control laws. A new investment-screening law, currently before Parliament, will grant ministers new powers to block the acquisition of shares, land or intellectual property in sensitive sectors. Last summer the government announced it would reverse an earlier decision to permit Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, to help build Britain’s fifth-generation telecoms networks.

That decision followed intensive lobbying from Donald Trump’s administration to break ties with China. Britain’s new approach places it firmly in step with the Biden administration which, like Mr Trump’s White House, accuses Beijing of genocide; unlike the Trump administration, it is keen to work with allies to counter China. This is an opportunity for Mr Johnson, who plans to use the G7 meeting in Cornwall this June as the launch for an expanded grouping of democracies including Australia, India and South Korea.

China’s response to Britain’s new stance has so far been limited to rhetoric. CGTN said Ofcom had been “manipulated by extreme right-wing organisations and anti-China forces”; the Hong Kong visa offer was denounced as unwanted colonial meddling. But things may change, and British companies may suffer high-profile sanctions similar to those imposed by China on Australia, reckons Charles Parton, a former British diplomat and senior associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute. AstraZeneca, Jaguar Land Rover and HSBC have been floated as possible targets in the Chinese press. And after CGTN’s closure, life may get trickier for BBC journalists in China. Mr Parton says China will bide its time: “I think we’re going to get the Australia treatment, but they serve their revenge a lot colder than you think.” ■
