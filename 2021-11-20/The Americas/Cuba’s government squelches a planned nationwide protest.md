YUNIOR GARCÍA AGUILERA, a leader of Cuba’s pro-democracy movement, had hoped to join a protest against the government on November 15th. It was planned as a follow-up to demonstrations in July. This time security forces detained activists in advance and blocked the street along which Mr García had planned to walk holding a white rose, the movement’s symbol. The protest was small. Mr García later turned up in Spain.
