SAM HAGGER shut the three pubs he owns in and around Leicester a few days before the government ordered a national lockdown last March. Many of his workers were deeply upset, but the younger ones—about half were under 25—were relatively sanguine. Some even brought cakes and cards to the pubs, as though misfortune had befallen not them but somebody else.
Had they guessed what was coming, they might have been more anxious. Covid-19 and the measures Britain has deployed to suppress it have disrupted young people’s working lives more than anyone else’s over the past year. They have responded in ways that are sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful to their prospects. This can be seen in Leicester, a city with a median age of just 32 that has been locked down for an unusually long time.

Thanks largely to the government’s furlough scheme, which pays workers to do nothing, unemployment has not surged. Still, the number of employees in February was 693,000 lower than a year earlier. Of those missing workers, almost two-thirds are under 25; 18- to 24-year-olds are also more likely to be furloughed than any other age group.
Some of that reflects the “last in, first out” hiring-and-firing pattern common in recessions, says Hannah Slaughter of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank. But the main explanation is that young people cluster in the worst-hit sectors. In 2019, 32% of 18- to 29-year-old workers were in hospitality, retail or arts and leisure. Young people dominate those industries even more than they did in past decades.
Young people entering the labour market have an especially hard road. “The competition has doubled,” says Sunah, who has been studying finance at De Montfort University. She reckons that companies are concentrating on bringing their many furloughed and remote workers back to the office, and will only begin hiring when they have done that. If she cannot get a graduate job by the summer, she plans to look for part-time retail work.
Understandably, many are steering clear of the job market altogether. Helped by a mess-up over A-levels, which led to grade inflation last year, 42.6% of 18-year-olds had applied to university by January 15th, up from 39.5% a year earlier. Practical courses that seem to lead to jobs (such as medicine) have been especially popular, humanities subjects not so much.
Those who have jobs cling to them. PPL PRS, a Leicester-based outfit that licenses music, has about 70 staff under the age of 25, many of whom work in its contact centre. In normal times, young call-centre workers hop from job to job, chasing small increases in pay, says Kevin Underdown, head of human resources. These days most are staying put—partly, he says, because they fear that if they leave they could become ineligible for furloughing.
In normal times young people’s pay grows quickly, albeit from low levels. Now that they are moving less, the escalator has slowed down. The Resolution Foundation estimates that the pay of the average 18-to-24-year-old rose by 6% last year, down from 12.3% in 2019. Their earnings could be suppressed for years, as happened to people who were in their 20s when the financial crisis hit.
Mr Hagger’s company is beginning to hire again, on the assumption that Britons will flock to pubs when they are allowed to. But he wonders whether young people will be keen to return to work. As he puts it, “They’ve had a break in service.” Many of them have been stuck at home for most of the past year—something that has been miserable, but perhaps also dangerously habit-forming.■
