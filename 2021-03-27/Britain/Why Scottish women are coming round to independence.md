WITH THE possible exception of William Wallace, the best-known Scottish nationalist was, for a while, a woman. In 1967, Winifred Ewing, “a slight, blonde woman in a purple coat” in the words of one newspaper, became only the second Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate to be elected to Westminster. (The first, Robert McIntyre, only lasted three months.) When she arrived at Parliament, policemen escorted her through a crowd of supporters waving saltires. She soon became known as “Madame Ecosse”.
By the time Scotland got its say on independence, in the referendum of 2014, the cause had become a rather more male affair. Nicola Sturgeon, whom Mrs Ewing mentored, played second fiddle to Alex Salmond, then the first minister and party leader. The campaign was, in the words of a female nationalist, “dominated by shouty men”. And male supporters of independence outnumbered female ones. A narrow majority of men (51%) and only 42% of women voted for independence, according to YouGov. “The women’s vote effectively lost the referendum,” says Elaine C. Smith, a comedian and nationalist campaigner.

Since the referendum, the gender gap has narrowed sharply. Most polls now either report a negligible gap or suggest independence is more popular among women than men (see chart). If that trend persists, it removes a significant obstacle in the path to independence. What, then, has changed women’s minds?

The most obvious explanation is change at the top. Mr Salmond resigned the day after the referendum. His successor, Ms Sturgeon, is popular with a majority of men but even more so among women. That remains true despite the public mud-slinging between , which culminated this week with an inquiry concluding that she did not break the ministerial code. By contrast, men were much more likely than women to view Mr Salmond favourably. Ms Sturgeon insists on a gender-balanced cabinet (in fact, women outnumber men) and has introduced family-friendly measures like giving a free box of clothes, books and a thermometer to the parents of every new baby.
Ms Sturgeon’s popularity does her cause no harm, but it cannot entirely explain the swing. As Heinz Brandenburg of Strathclyde University points out, the polls started to shift only in 2018, four years after she took the top job. And analysis by the Scottish Centre for Social Research suggests that Mr Salmond was not the only cause of female scepticism last time round, since even women who thought highly of him were less likely to support independence than were men who also rated him highly.
External factors probably also explain the change. Women tend to be more risk-averse than men. That may account for their lack of enthusiasm for constitutional change in other parts of the UK (see chart). Scottish independence is as risky as ever, but Brexit and the economic uncertainty induced by the pandemic mean that the status quo appears less predictable than it was in 2014, says Ailsa Henderson of Edinburgh University. It may therefore no longer be clear to women which is the least risky option. Ms Henderson has found that women are over-represented among Scots who voted No in the 2014 referendum and against Brexit but now support independence. These days, Mrs Ewing is far from the only Madame Ecosse. ■
