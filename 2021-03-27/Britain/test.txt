Disraeli, the grandson of a Jewish-Italian immigrant who sold straw hats, was the only 19th-century prime minister not to attend a public school or Oxbridge. At first glance, Mr Johnson’s background looks quite different. He was “stuffed to the gills with the finest education England could offer” at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, as he put it, but he is more exotic than this suggests.

He follows Disraeli’s example in making up for a shortage of detail with a surplus of imagination: his speeches are an amalgam of references to past glories and vague promises to create a space programme or build a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.
