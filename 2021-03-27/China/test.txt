The first work, “Divorce in China: Institutional Constraints and Gendered Outcomes” by He Xin of Hong Kong University, was published in January.

In contrast, Ms Guo sought an uncontested divorce from a civil-affairs office. A clerk ended her marriage in 20 minutes because she sought no assets or compensation from her husband, who had found another woman. “I had a smooth divorce, at great economic and psychological cost,” she says over Coca-Colas near her factory in Shenzhen.

Enough well-meaning laws have been passed to suggest that leaders do want a more female-friendly China. The solution to the puzzle lies in the Communist Party’s priorities.

But party bosses take a utilitarian, greatest-good-for-the-greatest-number view of human happiness. Thus judges who bully individuals and place efficiency above fairness are just doing their duty. As for maintaining social stability, that is an overriding obsession of party officials. And a reliable way to avoid social unrest is to side with the powerful against the weak. In a Chinese divorce court that means denying women their rights. In an autocratic regime, cruelty is not an accident, it is structural.
