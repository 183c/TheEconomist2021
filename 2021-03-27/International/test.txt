Brain injuries affect about 8.5% of the general population but rates among prisoners are far higher. Kim Gorgens, a neuropsychologist at the University of Denver, reckons that between 50% and 80% of prisoners and those on parole in America have brain injuries. A review of research in America, Australia and Europe suggests that the average reported rate is around 46%. Research conducted in 2010 by Huw Williams of the University of Exeter put the rate among men in British prisons at 65%. A study published in 2017 found that nearly half of all prisoners in New Zealand had been hospitalised for a traumatic brain injury before committing their crime. Researchers suspect that the numbers may be even higher in poorer countries because road-traffic accidents and violence are generally more common.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"People who sustain brain injuries are more likely to go on to commit crimes, including violent ones. They are more troublesome while in prison and more likely to reoffend on release. This is especially true for those, like Manuel, who are injured as children. Adrian Raine, a psychologist and criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, is pretty convinced that there is a causal link. He points to research that follows people over time, as well as natural experiments in which otherwise law-abiding individuals suffer a brain injury and then display antisocial behaviour. “It’s a bit like saying smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” Dr Raine explains. “Most people do not get lung cancer. We will never do a randomised controlled trial for it. But do we act on it? Sure we do.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"For many the damage is done early. Brain injuries are particularly common among boys and young men, whose brains are still maturing. Those from poor backgrounds who live in cities are especially at risk. A curious child who is rarely supervised is more likely to fall and seriously hurt himself. A reckless adolescent who thinks he is invincible is more likely to crash his car or get punched in the head. They are then far more likely to drop out of school and end up in prison.

In fact they are more usually caused by falls, road-traffic accidents and fights. The front of the brain, where the frontal and temporal lobes are located, is often damaged. Higher emotions, such as compassion, seem to be concentrated there, as does conscious decision-making. Long-term memory formation is mediated by the hippocampi, which are in the temporal lobes. Broca’s area and Wernicke's area, both important in the development of language, are located in the frontal and temporal lobes respectively.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The longer a person is unconscious, and the more injuries they sustain, the more severe the effects.

Some 96% had problems with substance abuse and 79% suffered from some kind of mental illness. It is a vicious cycle, says Dr Gorgens. Substance abuse is more likely in people who have suffered brain injuries, and people with brain injuries are more likely to develop addictions. Separate research shows that after suffering a brain injury, people with mental-health problems were four to seven times more likely to commit a crime than before. When you are dealing with so many problems at the same time, it is easy for them to spiral out of control, explains Dr Gorgens. This is especially true for those who have alienated their family and friends, as people with brain injuries tend to do.

Officers of the court talk to defendants in clear English instead of legal jargon, and provide handouts to those who struggle to understand what is being said. “It’s fundamentally a matter of fairness,” says John Walker, the court’s founder and chief judge. “If a person came into the court who couldn’t speak English, they would be given an interpreter.” He argues the same should be true for those with neuro-disabilities.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"figure","attribs":{"itemtype":"https://schema.org/ImageObject"},"children":[{"type":"tag","name":"img","attribs":{"title":"","caption":"","src":"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210327_IRD002_0.jpg","width":"608","height":"934","alt":"","data-slim":"1","data-teg-id":"1so0kcnpt1h30a4v0um4fpnoqbcs1n6l"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Philippa Birch works for The Disabilities Trust, a British charity that trains people to go into prisons to raise awareness of brain injuries among inmates and staff.

That might mean medication: antidepressants for anxiety or stimulants for fatigue and improved cognitive function. But in the long term most treatments for brain injuries are largely therapeutic. Neuro-rehabilitation relies on recognising that the brain is to an extent able to adapt its structure and function, a process known as neuroplasticity. Physical and speech therapy can help people regain lost function. Computerised “brain training” games can improve recall and attention.
