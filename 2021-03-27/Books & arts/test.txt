The answer may lie in their hybrid nature. In form, the language of social media is written—but in style, it is far more like speech.

People write them as they speak, using sentence fragments, slang, non-standard spellings (to reflect pronunciation) and so on.

So many people (including path-breaking members of minority groups) will be deemed to have transgressed that skeletons in closets come to be regarded as inevitable.
