That kind of data can help donors better target their aid efforts. Emily Aiken of the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues have tested whether a machine-learning algorithm can identify the poorest households in 80 Afghan villages based on mobile-phone data, such as the duration of their calls, their network of contacts, and how often they paid for more minutes of call-time.

Daniel Rogger and Ravi Somani of the World Bank once asked over 1,800 officials in Ethiopia how many people lived in their districts. About half of them thought their districts were at least 50% bigger or smaller than they actually were, according to figures in their own databases.
