The following year he went to his first cattle drive. His grandfather, whom he remembered as a man with a fine moustache and a habit of whittling his own toothpicks out of sweet-smelling cedarwood, built the ranch in Archer County, north-west of Fort Worth, from literally nothing. He had stopped the waggon there for no other reason than because he’d spotted a fine seeping spring that would assure the family plenty of water. Lore had it that it was a place without a house, on land that had never been ploughed, at the edge of the Great Plains stretching all the way to Canada. His grandmother, who spoke little, raised 12 children on that stark frontier. All that rooting, with time, became ever more fixed in the arid Texan soil, yet the boy turned out to be not at all what either of them had expected.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Throughout this childhood, he would recall, the contrast between what he should have been afraid of—snakes, bulls, stampedes—and what he was actually afraid of was something almost shameful for his grandfather, his father and his eight uncles, all of whom had become ranchers. The most frightening thing in his early childhood, hands down, was poultry, with trees and shrubs a close second. He never quite got over seeing a great white owl fly out of the outhouse, right in his face, when he was a child. He was a young cowboy who hated his horse, he said, and feared almost every animal on the place.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"figure","attribs":{"role":"presentation","itemtype":"https://schema.org/WPAdBlock"},"children":[]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"When eventually he found what he really loved, he would hide away with it in the loft of the barn, partly because, there, he was safe above the pecking chickens, turkeys and guinea hens, but partly also because when he did occasionally look up from it, he could glance north and south and take in the whole ranch.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"When he was six, a cousin of his named Robert Hilburn stopped by on the way to the war, and dropped off a box of 19 books.

His fascination was with the way books looked, the heft of them, the smell of the printing ink, and of course, what was inside them.

He had the same postal address for virtually his whole life—Box 552, Archer City, Texas.
