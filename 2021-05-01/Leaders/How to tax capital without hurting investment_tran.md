GOVERNMENTS RAISE most of their money by taxing wages, but President Joe Biden has his eyes fixed on the rich, big business and Wall Street. He proposes to fund his $2.7trn infrastructure plan in part by raising the corporate-tax rate from 21% to 28%. And to help pay for more spending on child care and support for parents, he wants to roughly double the top rate of federal tax on capital gains and dividends. For Americans earning more than $1m per year, he would bring levies on capital income into line with the top rate on wage income, which he wants to put up from 37% to 39.6%. That is about double the rate that is currently levied on rich investors, who are only a small fraction of the population but a large proportion of shareholders.
Many investors, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, are up in arms, claiming that Mr Biden will crush economic growth. That is an exaggeration; America can bear . Yet levies on capital can have unintended economic consequences. If he is to avoid them, Mr Biden should improve the design of his plans.

Taxing savings and investment income can seem like unfair and inefficient double taxation. Those who earn today to spend today must pay only income and consumption taxes; why should someone who prefers to gain by deferring their gratification face extra levies? Discouraging saving and investment hurts the economy in the long run, which is why a review in 2010 by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, ranked corporate taxes as the most harmful of four common taxes to economic growth. Economic models predict that Mr Biden’s business-tax plans would cut the size of America’s economy by around 1% by 2050.

Set against this is the scourge of tax avoidance. Tax capital lightly and it pays to disguise wages as capital income—a particularly lucrative pastime for the rich. One problem is the “carried interest” loophole. It lets private-equity and hedge-fund managers class their fees as capital gains rather than income. Another issue is the explosive growth in “pass through” firms, for example partnerships, which accounted for more than half of American business income by 2011, up from about a fifth in 1980. Many capital-light, labour-intensive businesses such as law firms, consultancies and medical offices are organised this way. Nearly half of the earnings that pass-through investors receive are classified as dividends and capital gains. Mr Biden is right that bringing taxes on wages and capital into line would make tax avoidance harder.
The trade-off between inefficiency and tax avoidance is painful, but two principles can help chart a sensible course. The first is to realise that taxes on capital stack up. Before they can return their profits to investors in the form of dividends and capital gains, firms pay corporate taxes. Whack up every capital levy to rates resembling income taxes and you will take a larger bite out of investment income than out of wages. Shareholders in California, for example, face Mr Biden’s proposed 28% corporate-tax rate, his 39.6% federal capital-gains rate, a 13.3% state tax on capital gains, and a 3.8% levy on investment income introduced as part of Obamacare. They could, in theory, keep less than a third of their nominal returns under the Biden plan—and even less of their real returns given that some of those taxes would be paid on the illusory capital gains generated by inflation. In reality it is not as simple as compounding rates, because the corporate tax is leaky and the current system, egregiously, waives capital-gains taxes when assets are inherited. Still, after taking into account the revenues raised from closing loopholes, Mr Biden should ensure that taxes on capital do not rise above taxes on labour.
The second principle is to reduce inefficiency with allowances for investment. Exempting from capital taxation modest “normal” returns, which are usually measured by the interest rate on low-risk bonds, cuts distortions, as the normal return is in theory the minimum needed to make private-sector projects worthwhile. The idea is baked into America’s tax code for many types of investment but only until the end of 2022—and Mr Biden plans a new minimum tax on firms’ accounting profits which would interfere with the carve-out for the largest companies. Individual investors should also receive exemptions for the normal rate of return—which already happens in Norway and has been suggested in Britain by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. As Mr Biden proposes, inheritances should not be exempt from capital-gains tax.
Genuine parity between capital and labour taxation, tempered by investment incentives, might not raise as much money as Mr Biden’s current plans. But such a reform would still help pay for his spending and reduce tax avoidance—without making the American tax system needlessly inefficient. ■
