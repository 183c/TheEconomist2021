The most powerful person in the country has to queue up for lunch in a tiny cafeteria or else go upstairs to make a sandwich in his kitchen.

Wariness also stems from the reasonable belief that frugality should start from the top.

He is entitled to an annual allowance of £30,000 for refurbishment, but the work was carried out by Lulu Lytle, one of Britain’s most fashionable designers. (The previous decor is said to have smacked of John Lewis, a department store popular with the British middle classes but not, apparently, with the prime minister’s household.) How closely he was involved in browsing the rich colours and Moghul-inspired fabrics in which Ms Lytle specialises has not been revealed; though since he does not have the look of a man who spends a lot of time thinking about sofas and side-lamps, his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, is assumed to have taken charge.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The prime minister seems to have managed the financing of the redecorations with his usual cavalier shiftiness.

He is now going to be wasting even more time answering questions about these schemes.
