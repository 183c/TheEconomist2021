Among them was her great great grandmother Mary Big Mocassin, then nine years old, who felt the sudden heat of a bullet tear into her hip.

Again, white men in heavy fighting gear—this time company security guards—were breaking up a camp, one she had made to obstruct the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline beneath the sacred lands of her tribe. Hundreds of protesters were being tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed. Dogs were set on them, and now she was facing one with blood on its dark grey jaws.

One was of Zuzeca Sapa, a black snake that would destroy the world unless her people stood up to defeat it. Back then the snake was taken to be the new Interstate highway, surfaced with black tar. Now it was clearly the pipeline, 1,170 miles long and costing $3.8bn, intended to carry black oil from the North Dakota shale-oil fields to Illinois. On the way it threatened 380 archaeological sites; 26 were in the 40-mile stretch round the meeting of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers, where roots had first grown out of her feet.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"This was her father’s land. As a child she had noted every feature which later, as historian of the Standing Rock Sioux, it became her job to catalogue and preserve. The low rolling hills carried the remains of Arikara villages, with effigies arranged in stones and prayers laid for years on the ground. On the peak above her camp her father was buried, along with one of her sons. At the confluence of the rivers was a whirlpool that carved the sand into great spheres strewn along the banks, the sacred stones. Here beside the Cannonball river her grandfather had sun dances with Wise Spirit, her uncle climbed trees for honeycombs and the family hauled up water every day, to drink and live. Soon afterwards that history was part-destroyed by the damming of the Missouri, which left the water unsafe to drink, the whirlpool flat and bleached trees, skeletons of spirits, poking from the water.

Her way was to invoke the past like a mantra, as she did when she quickly, firmly gave her real identity to any white interviewer: Tamakawastewin, “Her Good Earth Woman”, Sissintonwan Dakota from her mother, Oglala Lakota from her father. Yet she also had land, and in April 2016 she set up the Sacred Stone camp at Standing Rock as a spiritual centre of protest. Only a few came at first; locals brought them coffee, firewood and sleeping bags. But a social-media appeal drew hundreds, then thousands, eventually in two camps, in tents and yurts and maple-pole tipis. The seven bands of the Sioux met there for the first time in 140 years. The camps overflowed with horses, dogs, children, singing, story-telling and the smell of frybread. Tribal flags from almost every state lined either side of the route down to the pipeline site, where young men riding bareback would line up to block the road.

The leaderless movement began to fall apart. Meanwhile the tribal council of the Standing Rock Sioux, as well as the local police, became disenchanted with the camps, their mess, cost and trouble, and joined federal agencies to drive them out. By March 2017 they were cleared, and through the miles of 30-inch light-green pipes the black snake oozed its way.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"This looked like defeat, but not entirely.
