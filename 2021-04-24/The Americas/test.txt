All remained calm when Fidel Castro was taken ill in 2006 and handed over the reins to Raúl, his younger brother. It did, too, when Raúl turned the presidency over to Miguel Díaz-Canel, his hand-picked successor, in 2018. At a Congress of the ruling Communist Party on April 16th-19th Raúl also relinquished command of the party to Mr Díaz-Canel, a 61-year-old apparatchik.

He allowed Cubans to buy houses and mobile phones, and to use the internet. With Barack Obama he re-established diplomatic ties with the United States. He separated the roles of party and government and introduced term limits. The Congress completed this rationalisation. Raúl’s fellow gerontocrats have left the ruling politburo (though Raúl’s son and son-in-law hold powerful military jobs).
