ENSCONCED IN ITS island fastness 100 miles from Florida, Cuba’s communist regime has outlasted countless premature obituaries. All remained calm when Fidel Castro was taken ill in 2006 and handed over the reins to Raúl, his younger brother. It did, too, when Raúl turned the presidency over to Miguel Díaz-Canel, his hand-picked successor, in 2018. At a Congress of the ruling Communist Party on April 16th-19th Raúl also relinquished command of the party to Mr Díaz-Canel, a 61-year-old apparatchik. A new, slightly younger leadership has seamlessly taken over, under the slogan “unity and continuity”. Yet the fact that the party had to proclaim that nothing is changing suggests that beneath the surface it worries that things might.
For almost half a century Fidel ruled with communist dogma and erratic Caribbean charisma. Raúl set about tidying up the mess he inherited. He launched a cautious economic reform, under which some 600,000 of the workforce of 4.8m are self-employed or in co-operatives. He allowed Cubans to buy houses and mobile phones, and to use the internet. With Barack Obama he re-established diplomatic ties with the United States. He separated the roles of party and government and introduced term limits. The Congress completed this rationalisation. Raúl’s fellow gerontocrats have left the ruling politburo (though Raúl’s son and son-in-law hold powerful military jobs). José Ramón Machado Ventura, a Stalinist enforcer who was second secretary, has gone but not been replaced. That leaves Mr Díaz-Canel free to reshape the party’s ranks.

With all trace of the charismatic authority wielded by the Castro brothers gone, the new leadership will be judged purely by results. Its problem is that there are few of these. True, the regime has handled the covid-19 virus effectively, thanks to its prowess in public health. But the pandemic has halted tourism and hammered an already weak economy. Declining aid from Venezuela, the impact of additional American sanctions under Donald Trump and long-standing inefficiencies have combined to squeeze imports and cause widespread shortages.
This prompted Mr Díaz-Canel to implement, on January 1st, a long-delayed unification of the two national currencies, and with it a huge devaluation. This is designed to force state companies to become more efficient and encourage them to export more. It has set off inflation which may reach 500% this year and could cause real wages to fall by 15%, reckons Pavel Vidal, a Cuban economist. This is an irreversible step. “There are only two possible paths: either progress in structural reforms and openness, or an unravelling,” Mr Vidal argued in a recent report.
Until now the incipient private sector has amounted to little more than a subsistence economy. Many economists expected the Congress to authorise private small and medium enterprises (SMEs). No such luck. Warning against “greed”, Raúl said sternly: “there are limits we cannot cross” because they would lead “to the destruction of socialism itself”. Nevertheless, the message from the Congress was that economic reform won’t stop, says Ricardo Torres, an economist at the University of Havana. He thinks SMEs will be gradually allowed, starting with food production and IT.
In a society infantilised by paternalism, younger Cubans are digitally connected and impatient. The past few months have seen unprecedented demonstrations for more cultural freedom by artists and activists. These groups include environmentalists, anti-racists and feminists. They are hard to dismiss as agents of “imperialism”, though Mr Díaz-Canel tried to. The regime is controlling this “the traditional way, with repression, constant arrests and permanent police harassment”, according to Rafael Rojas, a Cuban historian in Mexico. The Congress hinted at tiny chinks of greater openness: the party’s rigid ideology chief was replaced by Rogelio Polanco, a more “flexible” figure, says a party source. And Mr Díaz-Canel offered talks with young people and intellectuals, though they want much more.
The iron control of the Cuban police state is not immediately threatened. But frustration is growing. “Much more than before, people are saying they want to leave,” says a young teacher. That is a problem in a country whose population is declining. When post-revolutionary generations came to power in China and Vietnam they made sure that their people felt the benefits of economic growth through state capitalism. Mr Díaz-Canel will ignore that lesson at his peril.
