Benjamin Disraeli attacked Robert Peel’s decision to repeal the Corn Laws on the grounds that it would dissolve the feudal ties that kept Britain together. The ensuing split consigned the party to two decades in the wilderness. Stanley Baldwin dressed as a tweedy squire and denounced “hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war”. Harold Macmillan, the son of a publisher who married a daughter of the Duke of Devonshire, preferred the feudal nexus to the cash nexus.
