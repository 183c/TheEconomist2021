##### Regulators will limit their availability

HOMEOWNERS TEND to be more inclined to vote Conservative than tenants. But they are at their happiest when house prices are growing, and that makes it tougher for first-time buyers to join the club. So Tory governments are faced with a conundrum: how to usher new members into their natural constituency while keeping property prices buoyant?
Prices have certainly been buoyant. Even the worst recession in at least a century failed to cool the market in 2020. According to the Office for National Statistics, house prices more than trebled in the two decades after 2000 while earnings, in cash terms, merely doubled. Buying a house for the first time has rarely been more difficult. In the mid-2000s, even after the 1990s house-price boom, the typical first-time buyer needed savings equal to around 30% of their annual income to make up the deposit required for a mortgage. Nowadays they need to scrape together a pot worth more like 70% of their income.The result has been  rates among younger and now middle-aged Britons.

The government’s latest attempt at a solution, launched on April 19th, seeks to boost the supply of mortgages with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio above 90%. In the heady days of 2007, this type of high-risk lending accounted for a sixth of the market. That it never regained those heights was seen as a good thing by regulators following a financial crisis for which it bears some of the blame. But after the pandemic prompted lenders to discontinue almost all their remaining high LTV products, the government started to worry that renters lacking large deposits would be locked out of the housing market for good. And so the Treasury is now offering to insure new mortgages with LTV ratios between 91% and 95% that are used to buy homes worth less than £600,000. It hopes that government backing will convince banks and building societies to extend more credit to first-time buyers who lack significant savings or a wealthy Bank of Mum and Dad.
Despite this, a flurry of 95% LTV mortgages backed by the Treasury is unlikely. For a start, there is no clamour for them from would-be borrowers. Richard Donnell, research director for Zoopla, a property website, notes that the Help to Buy scheme has allowed first-time buyers to put down 5% deposits since 2013. Yet nearly half have seemed wary of taking on excessive debt, opting to pay higher deposits instead. Meanwhile, some building societies that offer eligible mortgages are declining to take up the government’s offer, citing the restrictions on securitisation.
Most importantly, the Treasury’s guarantees do not remove the regulatory constraints placed on lenders to prevent a repeat of pre-financial-crisis excesses. Banks are allowed to allocate a maximum of 15% of their lending to mortgages worth more than 4.5 times the borrower’s income. Research by Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts, a consultancy, shows that the average first-time buyer in Britain spends 4.6 times their income on the purchase. In pricey London, the multiple is 5.4.
So it is only in the less expensive parts of the country that banks will be able to extend many mortgages to the average buyer with a 5% deposit, even if they want to. In that case, they will be faced with the higher capital requirements levied on mortgages whose LTV ratio is above 85%. They will also need to demonstrate that the borrower could still afford their mortgage repayments in a “stress tested” scenario where the interest rate jumps by three percentage points. Most will fail that test.
Mr Hudson describes this as “a tension between the regulators and policymakers about where the appropriate balance is between financial stability risk and home ownership”. As long as house prices stay at their current, elevated multiple of incomes, it is difficult to see how that tension can be resolved. For now, and despite the new scheme, the regulators have the upper hand.■
