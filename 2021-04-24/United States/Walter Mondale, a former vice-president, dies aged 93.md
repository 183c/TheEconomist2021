THE CAREER OF Walter Mondale is a reminder of how unfair politics can be. As a legislator he was among the greats, helping to drag the Democratic Party towards acceptance of civil rights, including as co-sponsor of the Fair Housing Act, which made it illegal for landlords to discriminate by race. As vice-president to Jimmy Carter he is credited with making that office more professional. As a presidential candidate in 1984, though, he was a disaster, losing 49 states to Ronald Reagan (whose record on civil rights was poor) in one of the most lopsided elections in American history.
