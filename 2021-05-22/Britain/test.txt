He sees groups such as Palestinians and Kashmiris as the global equivalents of the British working classes, a homogeneous mass of the oppressed rather than particular peoples operating in particular contexts.

They should pour cold water on ethnic passions even while recognising the power of those passions. They also need to cut self-proclaimed community leaders and “friends” organisations down to size, for neither is truly representative. Most ethnic communities are divided about foreign policy: many British Jews oppose Israel’s policy in the West Bank while many young Muslims ignore the elderly imams who claim to speak on behalf of their faith.

But cricket also provides an example of the opposite.
