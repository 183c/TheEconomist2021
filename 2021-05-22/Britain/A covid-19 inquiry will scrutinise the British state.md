###### Trial of the century
# A covid-19 inquiry will scrutinise the British state 
##### It will be long, complex, and may not change very much

ROCK FEILDING-MELLEN had firm views on the cladding that was to coat Grenfell Tower, a council housing block in west London. “I really don’t like the lime green and champagne combination at the ground floor,” he wrote in an email to colleagues in July 2014. The councillor responsible for housing in the borough recalls only “skimming” a bulletin from London Fire Brigade which he received the same month. Three years later the new cladding spread a blaze that killed 72 people. On May 18th Mr Feilding-Mellen told an inquiry: “I really don’t know what I could have done differently.”
Before long Boris Johnson will be searching his memory in a similarly bright room. He announced on May 12th that Britain is to hold a public inquiry into the government’s response to covid-19, starting next spring. It will have the power to compel documents and question witnesses under oath. The state will be on trial.

Once reserved for the gravest scandals, public inquiries have become almost routine. Marcus Shepheard of the Institute for Government ( IFG), a think-tank, tallies 83 since 1988. Seventeen are under way now, into affairs including contaminated blood transfusions, a terrorist attack in Manchester and undercover police operations.
The covid-19 inquiry will be the most complex yet. It will scrutinise a prime minister’s deliberations as only the Butler and Chilcot inquiries into the Iraq war have before. Many inquiries study a single organisation or a disaster that unfolded in minutes. The pandemic has been long and widespread and has claimed 128,000 lives. The inquiry may need to interact with others in Scotland and Wales and with various legal actions.
The people who lead public inquiries must do several things. They are both crime scene investigators and juries naming the culpable. They must suggest ways to fix systems. They are also priests, who comfort the bereaved. They must knit the past and the future, answering cries for both “the truth” and “never again”. They do not always succeed.
The task often falls to judges. They bring gravitas and neutrality, and are adept at running large proceedings and establishing facts. Lord Saville’s inquiry into Bloody Sunday spent 12 years recreating a 10-minute shooting spree by British soldiers in Northern Ireland. Sir Robert Owen performed a similarly thorough dissection of the murder of the Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko. Judges are less good at designing policy. The covid inquiry will probably require a panel of experts in government and epidemiology to help.
It will probably begin with a tussle over the terms of reference. Dozens of avenues might be explored: Britain’s contingency planning, the scientific advice, what happened in care homes, and the impact on schooling and jobs. Some campaigners hope it investigates why non-whites have suffered disproportionately. It must be exhaustive to avoid charges of cover-up, says Sir Lawrence Freedman, a member of the Chilcot panel: “You’ve got to tell the whole story.”
The longer it takes, the less useful it will be. The average inquiry lasts over three years; Chilcot took seven, during which time it reviewed 150,000 documents and interviewed 150 witnesses. The chair could speed it up by splitting it into streams, delegating fact-finding to outside experts and setting a deadline.
Inquisition does not always encourage openness. “Everyone gets lawyered up,” says Gus O’Donnell, a former cabinet secretary. Star witnesses at the Leveson inquiry into newspaper ethics suffered bouts of forgetfulness. One law firm advises likely participants to avoid discussing mistakes by email. Lord O’Donnell thinks it would be more useful to conduct stress-tests, akin to those for banks, to see how the state handles crises such as cyber-attacks. “The problem with inquiries is all they tell you is how to fight the last war,” he says.
File and forget
They can gather dust, too. Inquiries produced 2,625 recommendations between 1990 and 2017, reckons the IFG. An inquiry into the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster brought dramatic reforms. But problems with radios identified after a fire at King’s Cross underground station in 1987 were not resolved by the time terrorists struck in 2005. “The real issue is whether there is political will,” says Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary who implemented Sir Robert Francis’s report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. Sir Robert, a barrister, became a champion for patient safety. Judges, averse to political lobbying, tend to publish and move on.
Yet an inquiry’s influence can be greater than its prescriptions. The Macpherson inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a black teenager, made 70 recommendations. But it was his finding that the police were “institutionally racist” that shaped modern Britain. Even botched inquiries can have an impact. Lord Leveson’s inquiry was rambling, said little about the internet, and its call for new regulation was rejected by the government and the press. Yet it was a humiliating episode for tabloid editors, whose papers nine years on are tamer beasts. A blaze of sunlight is an uncomfortable thing. ■
