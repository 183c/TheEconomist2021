Lone children must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own.

Lots of those newly rich families have one child, a daughter, and—quite properly—are ambitious for her. The Beijing College Students Panel Survey, a big study, found that women students are more likely than men to come from affluent big-city families (and to study liberal arts).
