The financial press often writes about money flowing into stocks, but for a security to be bought, it also has to be sold. The authors’ definition of inflows relies on the fact that investment funds often promise to maintain a fraction of their portfolio in equities (a retirement fund offered by Vanguard, say, might offer investors 80% exposure to stocks and 20% to bonds). A flow into stocks is defined as an investor using fresh cash, or the proceeds of selling bonds, to buy funds that hold at least some equities. The higher the share devoted to equities, the larger the “flow”. The amount of securities in existence does not change—for every buyer, there is a seller—but their price is forced up until the value of the market is sufficient to satisfy each fund’s mandate to hold the target fraction of its portfolio in stocks.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Using statistical wizardry the authors isolate flows into stocks that appear unexplained (by, for example, ","type":"text"},{"type":"tag","name":"small","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"GDP","type":"text"}]},{"data":" growth) over the period from 1993 to 2019.

The authors note that at the onset of the global financial crisis hedge funds owned less than 4% of the stockmarket, and that their trades tended to amplify market movements, not dampen them.

It also threatens associated financial theories. One is the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which says that it does not matter whether a company finances itself with equity or with debt. In inelastic markets, by contrast, a firm that issues debt to buy back its stock will find that it drives up both its own share price and the broader market. The authors look only at stocks, but other research suggests that bond markets are inelastic (albeit to a lesser degree). As a result, central banks’ quantitative-easing policies, under which they buy bonds, will affect bond yields—something that many traders take as given but that purists say should not happen.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Messrs Gabaix and Koijen hope to inspire research that explains market movements using the granular, observable choices of investors, rather than attributing gyrations in markets to unobservable changes in beliefs.
