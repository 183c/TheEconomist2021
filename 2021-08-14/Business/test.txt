The higher the valuation Instacart achieves, the more it suggests that supermarkets will get the short end of the stick. As some of Instacart’s exclusive arrangements with them reportedly begin to expire, the big grocers may be realising this.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Far from the digital throne room of Facebook, Ms Simo has now thrust herself into one of the gnarliest corners of the real world, grocery, in one of the most cut-throat businesses, delivery. If the economics of delivery platforms, from ride-sharing to meals, are tough, those of hauling baskets of produce are even more so. Supermarket margins, already thin, are falling, according to Bain, a consultancy, leaving little left over for the costs of dropping stuff on doorsteps. Shoppers are increasingly price-sensitive; hence the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. At the height of the pandemic stay-at-home orders gave people little choice but to pay extra for delivery. But as conditions return to normal, so will cost-consciousness. In the three months to June, says Bloomberg Second Measure, a data company, year-on-year grocery-delivery sales fell, after stratospheric rises in most of the previous 12 months.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Ms Simo acknowledges that after a breathless year, Instacart is at a “new resting heart rate”. As the online share of groceries in America rises from a modest 8% of total sales, she sees plenty of growth ahead. But competition is heating up.

Ms Simo insists it will be the latter.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"She is losing no time. Already, she says, ad sales (reportedly $300m last year, or a fifth of revenues) are growing at triple-digit rates. But that’s just for starters. Within days of taking over the company, she raided Facebook for its top marketing executive, Carolyn Everson, naming her Instacart’s president. Ms Simo sees huge potential. Groceries, as she points out, are the largest segment in the retail sector. Until recently the $1.5trn consumer-goods industry was unable to target shoppers directly as they put groceries into their trolleys. They now can via internet shopping, and all the more effectively on the small screen of a mobile phone. Targeted ads give them even more bang for their buck.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Further supporting growth will be automation. Instacart, Ms Simo says, will continue to expand its numbers of packers and deliverers. But it recently signed a deal with Fabric, an Israeli firm, to build small-scale robotic warehouses attached to its partners’ supermarkets, which will make picking and packing quicker, enabling Instacart to cut delivery costs. The firm will also ramp up efforts to win hearts and minds of customers and staff. One approach, clearly, is to pay more attention to the female perspective, not least because women do most of the grocery shopping.

Ms Simo insists the benefits will be shared between Instacart and its partners. But, says Steve Caine of Bain, many of America’s big supermarkets are building their own online platforms to rely less on Instacart. The fightback has begun. It may not be a Hundred Years’ War.
