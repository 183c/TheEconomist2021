##### When terminations are banned in Poland, Polish women buy train tickets

WANDER AROUND any Polish city and the same phone number pops up on an array of unlikely surfaces. It is scrawled on bus stops and billboards. It can be daubed on the side of a church. Head online and the same number (+48 222 922 597) appears in people’s usernames. Those who dial it are put through to Kobiety w Sieci (“Women on the Net”), a group that offers women information on how to get abortions. In a country where providing terminations is now, in effect, illegal, it is a useful number to have.

In October Poland’s constitutional court struck down a law allowing abortion in cases of fetal abnormality. Of the 1,000 or so legal abortions in Poland per year before the ban, nearly all were in this category. Now, abortion is limited to cases of rape or to save a mother’s life. This fulfils a long-held dream of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party to clamp down on abortions. Activists responded by turning cities into a gonzo Yellow Pages. It also provided a burst of publicity for Abortion Without Borders, an alliance of organisations such as Kobiety w Sieci that help women who live in countries where abortion is restricted. After the Polish ban, traffic to the website shot up and calls poured in. Among the callers were angry priests, demanding to know who had plastered their church with the number of an abortion hotline.


Abortion laws within the EU are a patchwork. They range from relatively permissive in places such as the Netherlands to practically banned in Poland (and forbidden altogether in Malta). The bulk fall in between. There are no common rules. Normally, the EU steps in to harmonise law. On reproductive rights it has no competence. Given that the bloc ranges from the devout to the enthusiastically godless, EU officials would rather ignore the issue. Yet thanks to the free movement of people and goods—and the increasingly blurred distinction between European and domestic politics—the EU still makes it easier to obtain abortions within its territory, whether it tries to or not.

Consider how organisations such as Abortion Without Borders work. Activists in Poland offer only advice, which is perfectly legal. Groups based outside Poland will arrange the delivery of pills, book flights, arrange translators and pay for treatment. In one case, they even coughed up the deposit for a hire-car. In Poland these activities would leave them open to prosecution. In, say, the Netherlands, no one can touch them. Posting abortion pills into Poland requires beating the authorities. Crackdowns have been mounted in the past. “We found other ways,” says Dr Rebecca Gomperts, a campaigner for legal abortion. Thanks to the single market, sending a package from one part of the bloc to another requires no extra paperwork. It is easy for goods to slip through. If it is a game of whack-a-mole, the moles are winning.

Likewise, freedom of movement means that abortions available in one EU country are available to all EU citizens, provided they have the means to get there. Groups such as Abortion Without Borders make that possible by paying travel costs (and, during the pandemic, arranging covid-19 tests). Usually, the EU operates on the principle that a person or business should be treated roughly the same in any EU country. Without common rules, arbitrage comes into play: companies can move from states with tougher regulations to those with lighter ones. This is exactly what can happen, at least temporarily, when a Polish woman wants an abortion. She boards a train to where the rules won’t stop her.

Abortion law in Europe is, on the whole, liberalising. Ireland allowed abortion in 2018, as religious opposition faded and the law was routinely flouted by women who went to Britain for terminations. Availability varies between different European countries, however. Terminations beyond 12 weeks are tightly limited, with only a handful of countries offering them in most circumstances. (When Britain, which allows abortions with little restriction up to 24 weeks, left the bloc, the options were further reduced.) The upshot is that women head to wherever they can get what they want. Enter the waiting room in a Dutch clinic offering late-stage abortions and one will find women from across Europe.
Free to choose

To its critics, the EU is at best a poor defence against illiberalism and at worst an enabler of it. Under its watch, governments such as Poland’s have trampled on women’s rights, judicial independence and media freedom. Only this month independent media in Poland staged a blackout in protest at a punitive tax. Yet when it comes to abortion, the EU’s guarantees of free movement for goods and people serve unwittingly to spread a different kind of freedom of choice.

EU membership has liberalising effects in other, less obvious ways. When the EU was haggling last summer over €1.8trn ($2.2trn) of funds to be distributed to countries over the next seven years, some governments demanded the right to claw back the money if countries such as Poland trampled on the rule of law. Polish ministers dismissed that as an ideological assault, a punishment for Poland doing things liberal EU members did not like, such as limiting abortion. Actually, the reason other EU countries wanted to punish countries that threaten the rule of law was that countries such as Poland have been threatening the rule of law.

Where Polish ministers are right to be wary is that, eventually, decisions such as banning abortion will move into the arena of European politics. Politics follows money. And now the EU controls more of it. Taxpayers in rich countries may wonder what the governments spending their cash are up to. Voters in one country may not approve of funding a government that tramples on women’s rights, nobbles judges and hounds journalists. While restrictive abortion laws exist in places like Poland, the process will remain needlessly miserable. But safe, legal routes are still open—and there is little Poland’s rulers can do about it. In the EU an abortion is only a phone call away, no matter what the law says. ■
