ON FEBRUARY 18th “Perseverance”, a one-tonne NASA rover, landed on Mars. The miracles of modern technology meant that, for the first time, footage of the event could be transmitted back to Earth. By February 22nd viewers could watch the spacecraft carrying the rover descend by parachute. As it approached the surface it began to hover using rockets, before lowering the rover safely to the ground with cables.
