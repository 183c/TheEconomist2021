# Why Snowmageddon won’t change Texas 
##### Without political competition, there is little incentive for Texas to tweak its model

“TEXAS IS A mirror in which Americans see themselves reflected, not life-sized but…bigger than life,” wrote John Bainbridge in “The Super-Americans”, a book published in 1961 about the Lone Star state. Recently, the picture of Texas has been one of super-size suffering. A snowstorm and freezing temperatures caused power-equipment failures, leading to rolling blackouts. Around 4.5m households had to go without power and half of all Texans lost access to safe drinking water. Dozens have died and hundreds were poisoned by carbon monoxide. Survivors have had to contend with burst pipes in their homes, flooding and eye-watering electricity bills.

With most of the state shut down for a week, the disaster will probably become the costliest in Texas’s history, eclipsing the toll of even the worst hurricanes. President Joe Biden, who is planning to survey the devastation at first hand, has approved federal funds to help with disaster relief. In scenes reminiscent of a developing country, Texans lined up for food, blankets and bottled water.


The state’s leading politicians were quick to distance themselves from the disaster, physically as well as philosophically. Ted Cruz, a senator, jetted off to Mexico with his family; Ken Paxton, the attorney-general, flitted off to Utah. Others, including Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, cast blame on renewable-energy sources for the blackouts. The Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the oversight body that is meant to ensure the reliable functioning of the state’s grid, deserves some blame for Texans’ suffering, but the bigger failure lies in the state’s light-touch regulation and favouring of business interests. Will politicians learn the right lessons from this disaster?

The design of Texas’s grid reflects its wariness of government. Having a stand-alone grid—which is twice as large as any other state’s and larger than most countries’—ensures that Texas is not subject to federal rules. It deregulated and privatised its electricity market in the early 2000s. Texas has enjoyed lower-than-average electricity prices, which is good for consumers and industry, but the system does not encourage energy companies to forgo short-term profits to ensure that their equipment withstands extreme weather.

ERCOT is run without proper governance or oversight and is “accountable to no one”, says Edward Hirs, a lecturer at the University of Houston. Its board is packed with executives from the energy business who have a financial interest in the market they oversee, which is much like Wall Street financiers moonlighting at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ERCOT is the only transmission-system operator in North America to lack a fully independent board. A decade-old report by the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission, which reviews the performance of state agencies, recommended restructuring the board to make it more independent and increasing oversight, but its suggestions were ignored. Inattention and inaction help explain how ERCOT’s boss, Bill Magness, could receive $883,000 in pay in 2018, nearly six times as much as Mr Abbott’s salary.

Those who have called this February storm a once-in-a-century event have forgotten 2011. A decade ago a severe storm caused nearly a third of the state’s power-generating units to fail, causing rolling blackouts and prompting hearings into ERCOT. Yet experts’ suggestions—such as protecting equipment for winter conditions, increasing the grid’s excess capacity and reforming ERCOT—were ignored. “We fell short, because we didn’t demand the full implementation of those recommendations,” says Joe Straus, a former Republican speaker of the Texas House. “We knew what to do, we just didn’t do it.”

Natural disasters that highlight states’ vulnerabilities can be catalysts for change. In the 1990s, after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida and the Northridge earthquake struck California, both states updated their building requirements to withstand future disasters, says Mark Jones, a professor at Rice University in Houston. On February 24th, five of ERCOT’s board members who live out-of-state resigned, but more dramatic change is required. “We need to make sure they don’t just fire a bunch of people and find a way out of this short-term problem without addressing what we’ve known for a decade needed to be done,” says Mr Straus. “This has got to be the inflection point. The public is going to have to demand action.”

The state’s founders were so wary of government that they wrote into their constitution that the legislature should meet only every other year for up to 140 days. Yet limited government comes with limitations. Texas spends around $4,000 per person, 40% less than the average American state. Because it fought the expansion of Medicaid, a health-care scheme for the poor, it has the highest uninsured rate in the country, which probably contributed to the state’s higher-than-average death rate from covid-19.
Brrr-isket

Could this power crisis prompt a broader reckoning about the limits of Texas’s anti-government, low-regulation philosophy? Despite the reasons to think it should, that is unlikely, for three reasons. First is the flow of people and businesses to Texas, which has no state income tax. Failing at something as essential as heating and electricity may tarnish its image in the short term, but it is not likely to be a permanent setback. Elon Musk, who has expanded his companies’ operations in the state, has said that in 50 years Austin is going to be the “biggest boomtown” America has ever seen. Texan leaders will be disinclined to engage in deeper soul-searching when they have the validation of so many people moving to the state.

A second reason to doubt that bigger change will come is that there is no effective opposition to usher it in. After trumpeting the likelihood of making gains in the state legislature during last year’s election, Democrats did not do as well as expected. Texas remains a de facto one-party (Republican) state. “In what was supposed to be the most hopeful cycle in 25 years for Democrats, they face-planted and got nothing,” is how Evan Smith, the boss of the Texas Tribune, a non-profit news source, bluntly puts it. Not going out and campaigning door-to-door during the pandemic hurt Democratic candidates, as did perceptions that they wanted to defund the police. Republicans will now be in charge of redrawing electoral districts, setting back Democratic gains for at least the next decade, predicts Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a political-strategy firm.

A third factor is the political ambition of Texas’s current leaders and their desire to differentiate themselves from the Biden administration. Despite public scrutiny as a result of the grid crisis, Mr Abbott will stand for re-election in 2022 and is rumoured to be eyeing a run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024.

“Any time that Mr Biden gives in to the left wing of his party, those will be opportunities for Mr Abbott,” says Mr Jones. As state attorney-general, he sued Barack Obama’s government 31 times over policies including health-care and environmental regulations, turning Texas into the de facto capital of the resistance. That opposition is likely to continue on subjects such as energy, the border and social issues. Ken Paxton, the state’s current attorney-general, has his own reasons for keeping lawsuits against the federal government steady and frequent, since he will want to deflect attention from an ethics scandal and a reported criminal investigation by the FBI.

This resistance may seem hypocritical, given how much the state will benefit from having a Democrat in the White House. Under Mr Biden, Texas will receive more stimulus money, covid-19 relief and other federal funds than it would have done under a Republican administration. As Mr Abbott asks for help in navigating the aftermath of the storm, he is more muted in his criticism of Mr Biden than he might otherwise be. But he will not stay polite for ever. The largest red state may have gone dark for a week, but now that the lights are back on, Texas will show its true colours.■
