And after being given an easy ride by voters who saw it almost as a government of national unity, the Conservative Party is falling back to earth. The latest Survation poll puts Labour just two points behind (37 to 39). Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is narrowing the gap with the prime minister on whom to favour for the top job (33 for Sir Keir to Boris Johnson’s 40).
