# Procurement reforms offer a clue about Britain after Brexit 
##### They spell work for smaller firms, greater competition—and risks, too

“NO PROCUREMENT, NO lawyers, no meetings, no delay please—just send immediately,” wrote Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s then-chief aide, as he dispatched a grant of £530,000 ($740,000) to researchers at the start of the pandemic. Those who feared Brexit would spell protectionism, government bloat and vanity projects have found much to dislike in Mr Johnson’s approach to procurement. While campaigning for election in 2019, he promised a “Buy British” policy for state contracts once Britain was freed from European Union rules. On June 9th a judge declared that a contract for focus groups had been tainted by “apparent bias” and ruled it unlawful. Jolyon Maugham, the campaigning barrister who brought the case, has more under way over what he terms “institutionalised cronyism”.
The government’s plans for dramatic post-Brexit regulatory divergence are still blurry. But proposed legislation on public procurement brings the vision into sharper focus: a mixture of administrative reforms that could have been delivered within the EU, and legal tweaks that could not. They are neither a wholesale rending of red tape, nor trivial tinkering. The EU’s overarching principles of value for money, transparency and fair competition remain, but procedures will be simplified. Central government will become more powerful, with its buying power directed to meet Mr Johnson’s priorities. At the same time, checks on the executive will be weakened, at a time when a reputation for waste poses a growing political risk.

The modern procurement regime is the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, who brought compulsory competitive tendering to Britain’s councils and hospitals. Arthur Cockfield, Britain’s European Commissioner of the day, embedded it across the continent. Procurement now accounts for 32% of Britain’s public spending, a little above the average for the OECD, a club of rich countries.
Thatcher’s revolution rested on the idea that the market provides a degree of efficiency that governments cannot achieve alone. But that requires competition, which is often lacking, with some departments reliant on a few giant IT and construction firms. The result is market concentration, less innovation and more risk. Carillion, the government’s second-largest supplier when it collapsed in January 2018, had around 420 contracts, including for serving school dinners, building railways and cleaning prisons.
Lord Agnew, the minister behind the latest reforms, says that simplified procedures will make bidding less daunting. That should attract smaller suppliers, increase competition and improve resilience. Firms will need to submit the common information needed for procurement just once on a single platform. Authorities will be obliged to publicise upcoming contracts, and make data on their purchasing much more accessible.
Mr Johnson’s plans to “Buy British” are more modest than his liberal colleagues feared. Britain is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement at the World Trade Organisation, and to additional competition measures in its deal with the EU. That means not discriminating against foreign bidders for most contracts. But more of the government’s £290bn procurement budget will be nudged towards smaller British firms, as part of Mr Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda, which has seen spending rules tweaked to direct state funding to less-productive areas. Officials will be able to reserve low-value contracts for local firms. Such explicit carve-outs would probably have violated European law.
Buyers will be told to place much more weight on “social value” when comparing bids, and to take account of the government’s goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and improving skills. They will not, ministers stress, have to pick the cheapest bid. The Competition and Markets Authority, Britain’s antitrust regulator, has made approving noises: it says overemphasising cheapness can encourage big contractors to put in below-cost bids, thus locking out smaller competitors and becoming entrenched. A new enforcement unit will monitor compliance and create a blacklist of failing contractors.
Britain had already started to move in this more dirigiste direction. As prime minister between 2010 and 2016, David Cameron championed small traders and elevated social value. But writing new laws is much easier than changing the behaviour of the health authorities and local governments that control the bulk of spending, particularly when budgets are tight, says Tom Sasse of the Institute for Government. “In the last ten years the broad signals from government have been: ‘We want you to focus on social value, but actually we’re going to cut your budget by a third.’”
Shifting from objective measures such as cost to more subjective ones also increases the risk of cronyism. Moreover, the planned legislation loosens restraints on ministers and officials. A “crisis” clause will give them more freedom in an emergency than is offered by EU law. (In his newsletter Mr Cummings, now out of government and raging against it, says he was right to send the “no-procurement” email, and that “due process” during the pandemic was “killing people”.) The government thinks that frivolous legal cases brought by losing incumbents clog up procurement and deter small firms. It proposes new fast-track procedures, and a cap on the damages available to wronged parties.
The view in government is that the strict EU regime reflects fears about corruption that are unjustified in Britain. Mr Maugham says the upshot of capping damages will be fewer legal challenges, and more cronyism. One lawyer likens the British state to an old house, propped up for decades by a scaffolding of European law. Only when that is removed will it become clear whether the timbers are still sound, or rotten through. ■
