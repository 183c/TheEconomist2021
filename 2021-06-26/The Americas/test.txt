Returning in 2007, he has ruled ever since as an elected autocrat.

She was the best bet to unite the opposition.

While taking control of the legislature, the judiciary and the electoral authority and muzzling the media, he forged an implicit alliance with private business and with the churches. He kept support among the poor with social programmes paid for with $500m a year in aid from Venezuela. When this dried up, austerity prompted a national uprising in 2018 which involved Sandinista supporters as well as their opponents.
