Its ability to adapt to the demands of a fast-growing middle class, tweak its message to suit the public mood and even act on public suggestions is underappreciated. The leadership blamed the cover-up in Wuhan on local officials and honoured the late doctor (a party member) as a “martyr”. The party emerged seemingly unscathed. But it is also a mistake to dismiss party leaders’ fears. A book published by the party last September was entitled “Extracts from Discourses by Xi Jinping on Countering Risks and Challenges and Responding to Sudden Incidents”.

This explains the viciousness of the response, which has made it clearer than ever that China’s government is calling the shots in the territory (the party still does not operate openly there, but the central government’s representative is chief of the “Hong Kong Work Committee”). Taiwan looks anxiously on. The island has been in the party’s sights since 1949, when the government of Chiang Kai-shek, defeated by Mao’s forces, fled there. Its rulers say Taiwan is an independent country. The party says it is ready to use force to “reunify” it with the mainland if other means fail. That appeals to China’s nationalists, who often bray for a showdown.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"But Mr Xi is cautious. That is evident in his remarks about Taiwan. He talks of China’s great rejuvenation by 2049, and links that idea with reunification. But he makes no promise about achieving this on his watch. He wants to appeal to nationalists, not tie himself down. His threatening military manoeuvres in the Taiwan Strait and his talk of inevitable reunification play well at home. Nationalists buy his promise that China will be “prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful” by mid-century—even though they know that “democratic” is party-speak for an efficient dictatorship.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"So it is with Mr Xi’s professed belief in Marxism. By vaunting it, he ensures support from party conservatives. But he does not let it hamstring policies, which display the same ideological pragmatism that all leaders of the post-Mao era have shown. They give priority to the needs of urban residents: migrants from the countryside are second-class citizens. The super-rich are showered with honorary titles. Of about 5,100 people who are members of China’s parliament and its advisory body, more than 140 have fortunes of at least 2bn yuan ($320m), reckons Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based group (see chart).

On his watch, the final 100m people have been declared free of extreme poverty, helped by public spending of more than 1.6trn yuan. But income inequality is high and the welfare net is thin. Mr Xi is wary of those who take Marxism literally. Several members of a Marxist club at Peking University were arrested in 2018 for supporting strikers in Shenzhen.

Mr Ma’s business empire seems one the party should like. Alibaba and its financial-services company, Ant Group, have more than 200 party branches with 7,000 members, said Alibaba’s party chief in 2018. Yet Mr Ma stepped out of line by attacking regulators in a speech. That led to the halting of what would have been the world’s biggest initial public offering: listing Ant Group on exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Mr Ma dropped out of public sight for three months. Regulators forced Ant Group to restructure and fined Alibaba more than 18bn yuan for violating antitrust law.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The plight of such businesspeople suggests a difficulty with Mr Xi’s mission to keep the party in power while turning China into a technological and financial colossus.

One secret of the party’s longevity has been its willingness to give low-level officials freedom to be creative and even bend the rules. They have usually been judged more on their ability to boost economic growth than on their ideological correctness. A big drawback to this laissez-faire approach has been collusion between party officials and mafia-like gangs in industries such as property and transport. Mr Xi’s war against “black society”, as such criminality is called, has been popular. But he has also terrorised the bureaucracy, sucking the initiative out of local government. Jessica Teets of Middlebury College in Vermont says there are “really high resignation rates” among local officials.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"None of these problems suggests a party that is near collapse. But Mr Xi may test it over his own succession. Since 1949 the party has managed only one smooth transfer of power, from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao in 2002, and that was hardly a full transfer as Mr Jiang (now 94) remained military chief for another two years. Before Mr Xi, leaders tried to avoid traumatic successions by picking a replacement before stepping down. Mr Xi shows no sign of doing this. His sudden death or incapacity could throw Chinese politics into turmoil that could also destabilise society.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"But after Mr Xi may come another like him. For all the misgivings about Mr Xi that are doubtless shared by victims of his purges, as well as their associates, many senior officials share his view of the party’s vulnerabilities. It would take much daring for a new leader to loosen the reins. The party may not remain a political force in 100 years’ time.
