The sight of his father, for example, a reverend at a mission in Lubwa near the border with Congo, sitting on a hard wooden bench in church, while the white ministers sat on cushions; or the poor African women he had seen manhandled at a white butcher’s shop for protesting at the high prices and the rotten meat he sold them.

His parents had given him two commandments that stuck with him, Jesus’s words: Love God, and love your neighbour. Do unto others as you wish them to do unto you. To pick up a gun, as most fighters for independence did, made you no better than the killers you faced. When his early political organising took him in and out of British-run jails he read Gandhi, whose writings went straight to his heart. He resolved to live simply, give up drink and smoking, and take back his country without bloodshed. The new Zambia, no longer Northern Rhodesia, was to be a land of respect for people of all races, colours and religions. Facing down his more vengeful colleagues, he called his liberation push in the early 1960s the “cha-cha-cha” campaign, for a nation where everyone—Africans and Europeans, children and the unborn, even domestic beasts, even the queen—would dance together.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Behind the whimsy lay an iron resolve to keep Zambia united. “If I say ‘Let’s sing,’ just sing,” he told his followers.

In Africa, he believed, opposition to the ruler spelled destruction. In Zambia, a land of many tribes and languages, multi-party democracy would let its enemies, the white-minority regimes to the south, undermine it and break it apart. For 26 of his 27 years in power he suppressed even the thought of it. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed and beaten, while he ceaselessly reshuffled the posts in his own party to keep all ethnic groups on his side.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"His Zambia had a uniting moral philosophy to live by, his own invention, a mixture of Christianity, socialism and African traditions that he called “Zambian humanism”. Its main principle was the importance of man: no fellow should be richer than another, no man should exploit another, each person had value and dignity. He set the pace, living as his party’s leader in a house that had no power or running water, and as president steadily building schools, clinics and new roads, to give all Zambians a better chance. The people loved him for this, chanting “God in heaven—on earth, Kaunda!”, and calling him “KK” for short. Since he was a proud football fan, sometimes turning the whole cabinet out for a public kickabout, the national football team became the “KK11”.

The country was fundamentally rich, with huge reserves and exports of copper that paid for his social improvements. But if he was truly to eliminate all classes and close the gaps between rich and poor, miners and farmers, he had to bend the economy to his will, like everything else. He therefore nationalised the copper mines, froze miners’ wages and also froze prices, only to find that his policies discouraged farmers from planting and mining firms from investing. Then in 1974 the copper price fell off a cliff, trade to and from his landlocked country was disrupted by regional wars, and Zambia rapidly became one of the world’s most indebted nations.

Botha, South Africa’s racist leaders, man to man, to try to build bridges.

So although he had given the people multi-party elections in the end, they had decided against him in a landslide. And although his reputation recovered with the years, until he was once again the beloved father of his country and an icon of the liberation struggle, in public he still clutched the large white handkerchief in his left hand, power and regret together.
