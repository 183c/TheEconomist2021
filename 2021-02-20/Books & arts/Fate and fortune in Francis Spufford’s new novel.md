Light Perpetual. By Francis Spufford. Scribner; 336 pages; $27. Faber &amp; Faber; £16.99

FRANCIS SPUFFORD’S second novel has a basis in fact. His acknowledgments inform readers that in 1944 a V2 rocket destroyed a household-goods shop in south London. Among the 168 fatalities that day were 15 children. Similarly, “Light Perpetual” begins with a wartime explosion, in this case in the fictional London borough of Bexford. Here the German attack kills five children, robbing them of all their possible futures: “All the would-be’s, might-be’s, could-be’s of the decades to come.”


Rather than sketching the aftermath of the blast and introducing new characters, Mr Spufford instead imagines a quirk of fate that intervened to save these five young lives. After fast-forwarding to 1949 and showing Alec, Jo, Val, Vern and Ben alive and well, his alternative “reel of time” winds on, stopping every 15 years to chart the progress of each: what they have endured, where they have ended up, what challenges might lie ahead.

Bright boy Alec marries Sandra and secures a job as a typesetter in Fleet Street, but after a while both his relationship and his future “in the print” are threatened. Jo starts out as a singer in a dingy Soho club and continues her unfulfilling musical journey as a rock star’s girlfriend in the Hollywood Hills. And in a series of colourful episodes, Vern graduates from school bully to dodgy property developer and makes his money (before losing it all) from “primping the city’s past”.

The two other characters suffer their share of hard knocks. Ben’s affecting story takes him from psychiatric hospital to hospice by way of unexpected salvation. Val is unable to leave a Nazi boyfriend who spends his days “bruising and breaking”. One section of her tragicomic tale begins with a farcical skinhead meeting (“Who’d have thought that national socialism demanded so many sandwiches?”) and culminates in a bout of sickening violence.

“Light Perpetual” lacks the exploits and twists of Mr Spufford’s wonderful debut novel, “Golden Hill”, which was set in pre-revolutionary New York. Yet it develops into both a brilliant character study and a captivating ensemble piece. The doubly imagined lives of his resuscitated five are skilfully rendered: grasping Vern and his reversals of fortune provide comic relief, the others elicit sympathy as they achieve small triumphs and weather dashed hopes and failed dreams. Life, after all, is an opportunity to miss opportunities, make mistakes—and, sometimes, to put them right.
