A BAN ON SINGLE-USE plastics sounded like a good idea. But it has ended up enraging many women in Mexico’s capital, a city of 9.2m. Last week they discovered that they could no longer buy tampons with plastic applicators.

Mexico City’s government, which is led by a woman, Claudia Sheinbaum, has been implementing the law since the start of 2021. Its aim is to reduce the city’s solid waste, thought to be second only to the amount produced by the New York metropolitan area, measured by weight. Plastic bags, cups and straws have already been banned. It took until now for tampons with plastic applicators, the only kind that were easily available, to run out of stock in most shops.


Regina Soltero, a 23-year-old doctor who works 24-hour shifts treating covid-19 patients in a public hospital, says she depends on them. “They are comfortable and less likely to leak on my white uniform,” she says. Marina Robles, the city’s environment minister, added to women’s anger by declaring that tampons are not essential items. They are used mainly by prosperous women. Women should instead try reusable menstrual cups, which are made of rubber, said a city legislator.

Most Mexican women use pads, which are cheaper. Some young women think tampons cause them to lose their virginity, says Sandra Peniche, a doctor who runs a sexual-health organisation in Mérida in Mexico’s south-east. Others simply don’t know much about them. Dr Peniche has seen women who have worn a tampon for three days or had sex without removing it.

The ban is unlikely to help the environment much. Pads, which many women will now have to use—“I hate them,” says Dr Soltero—are at least as polluting. The ban will probably be quickly circumvented. Tampons are on sale in towns just outside the city. Pharmacies inside it are reportedly selling them under the counter. As Sergio Sarmiento, a journalist, pointed out, the ban doesn’t affect condoms, some of which are made of polyurethane, “despite them being plastic and used only once (I hope)”.

Dr Peniche reckons the tampon ban is yet another example of women’s needs being ignored—or worse. Last year, when thousands took to the streets to protest against a rise in murders of women, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an ally of Ms Sheinbaum, called them conservative opponents in disguise.
