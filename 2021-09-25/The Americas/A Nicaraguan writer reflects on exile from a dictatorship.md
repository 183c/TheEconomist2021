“MONSIGNOR IS ARMED with the word. The word is more powerful than a four-barrelled machinegun, comrade,” says Lord Dixon, a character in “Tongolele no sabía bailar” (“Tongolele didn’t know how to dance”), a new novel by Sergio Ramírez, a Nicaraguan writer. “Those are stupidities,” replies another. “Bullets rip through cassocks too.” And yet it appears that Lord Dixon, whose role is that of a chorus, is right. In the novel the bishop in question is so dangerous to those in power that they secure his exile to Rome. And Mr Ramírez’s novel has so enraged the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega that this month it issued an arrest warrant for him. “I think the book was the trigger,” Mr Ramírez told Bello. Mr Ortega has banned it and customs officers have been seizing copies.
The two men were once comrades. Mr Ramírez was vice-president, under Mr Ortega, in the revolutionary Sandinista regime of the 1980s. Mr Ramírez then joined a short-lived breakaway movement that embraced democracy and, when that fizzled, devoted himself to writing (he won the Cervantes prize, Spain’s most prestigious literary award, in 2017). Mr Ortega won an election in 2006 and, together with his wife Rosario Murillo, a devotee of esoteric cults, has clung to power ever since.

The charges against Mr Ramírez are totalitarian and specious. He is accused of laundering money, goods and assets, “denigrating national integrity”, “provocation” and conspiracy. The first relates to grants of $13,000 over five years received by his cultural foundation for journalism courses. The charges echo those used by Mr Ortega’s regime to throw three dozen political prisoners in jail, seven of them opposition hopefuls in a presidential election due in November, which will now be a farce.
Mr Ramírez saw what was coming when he was interrogated by prosecutors in June. After that he left the country. The warrant thus amounts to a sentence of exile. In the 1970s, during the Sandinistas’ struggle against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, Mr Ramírez lived as an exile in Costa Rica. Back then, he says, “I had my whole life in front of me to think that I might return.” Now he is 79. “The horizon is shorter. I have to accept the probability of never going back. This creates anguish and you have to struggle against that.” He leaves behind a house full of books, collected over many decades, which police have raided.
“Tongolele” is ostensibly a detective story. Its title refers to the nickname of the intelligence chief. Its rapid-fire dialogue is written in the slang of the Central American street. The crimes it portrays are crimes of state. Its subject is a popular uprising against the Ortegas in 2018 and its repression, during which more than 300 people were killed. The characters are fictional but the events were real. So is what the author calls “the dark, esoteric atmosphere”. So, too, were the paramilitaries, recruited from former guerrillas and the lumpen of Managua, who gunned down unarmed students using AK-47s and high-powered snipers’ rifles. They patrolled the city in unmarked Toyota Hilux pickups—just as the death squads of Argentina’s military junta did in unmarked Ford Falcons in the 1970s.
The Ortegas never appear by name in the book. It does, however, feature “the comandante” and the “señora”, “those at the top” whose whims inspire fear, paranoia and betrayal in a claustrophobic world in which fanaticism and opportunism are “twin diseases”. “Who are my enemies and who are my friends, now that all the dogs piss on me?” asks Tongolele, as he falls out of official favour.
“We saw how those who when young struggled for a new world inflicted a coup d’etat on the people, changing the constitution to perpetuate themselves in power in the name of a now-dead revolution, and we said nothing,” preaches the bishop in the novel. The students raised their voices and were slaughtered. Repression worked, Nicaraguans are scared and the Ortegas and their prison regime look secure. Nevertheless, Mr Ramírez thinks a return to democracy can only come from within. The regime “won’t last for ever”, he says. “There are moments when things suddenly change.”
Book-banning and the exile of writers have long been staples of Latin American dictatorships, including old-fashioned tyrants a century ago and military juntas in the 1970s. “Time is frozen in Latin America,” says Mr Ramírez. “It’s part of its attraction for novelists, that everything repeats itself.” It is part of the region’s tragedy that such dictatorships are no longer of the past.
