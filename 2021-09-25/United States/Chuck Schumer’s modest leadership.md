AS A SELF-DESCRIBED “angry centrist”, Chuck Schumer used to relish fighting his party’s radical fringe. In a centre-left manifesto he published in 2007, entitled “Positively American”, the Senate majority leader shuddered to remember the left-wing activists he had encountered at Harvard in the 1960s who “seemed to want to tear down every part of the American system”. He was even more contemptuous of his party’s unwillingness to repudiate them. “In politics, you have to either defend or denounce what your friends say,” wrote Mr Schumer. “If you don’t, people start to wonder what you really believe.”
The activist group he recalled has morphed into the Democratic Socialists of America, whose best-known member is Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She is widely believed to be mulling a primary challenge to Mr Schumer. Yet far from defining himself against her radicalism, he, the least well-known of the veteran Democratic trio running the government, has embraced it. He often appears alongside Ms Ocasio-Cortez in New York. And he has adopted a couple of her causes, student debt forgiveness and legal pot. For the many conservatives who detect AOC’s socialist hand in everything the Democrats do, Mr Schumer is Exhibit A.

The Democrats have indeed shifted to the left, albeit more modestly than their opponents claim. And as he has always swum in the party’s mainstream—much like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, the triumvirate’s other members—he has naturally shifted with it. Yet his benevolence towards the fire-starter from Queens is not only about protecting his left flank. It reflects Mr Schumer’s general approach to sustaining the slimmest possible Senate majority.
With just 50 votes plus that of Kamala Harris, the vice-president, and no prospect of Republican support on almost any of the major bills Mr Biden wants to get passed, Mr Schumer cannot afford to lose a single Democrat. Even with a bigger majority and less ambition, his Republican predecessor showed how hard that will be. Mitch McConnell passed a tax cut, failed to scrap Obamacare and left it at that. And the left—a tribe spanning Joe Manchin and Bernie Sanders—is more quarrelsome than the right. Mr Schumer’s response has essentially been to encourage his colleagues to push for whatever in Mr Biden’s agenda, loosely defined, they like best. And he has done so persistently, coaxing the party to hang together, in the hope that the longer a falling-out can be prevented the less likely it will be.
Where Mr McConnell and Harry Reid, the previous Democrat in his office, maintained an aura of immense power, Mr Schumer, the first New Yorker and Jew to occupy it, has a more relaxed style. He has tripled the size of Mr Reid’s kitchen cabinet, making it less a coterie of feared lieutenants than a team-building exercise, which includes Mr Sanders and Mr Manchin. With his signature flip-phone always to hand, he spends much of each day calling around his caucus, congratulating, cajoling or just checking in. The results of his more modest approach are better than many Democrats had expected.
A former attention-seeking legislator (“the most dangerous place is between him and a camera,” Bob Dole quipped) and campaign strategist, Mr Schumer was said to lack the grip of Mrs Pelosi, his counterpart in the House. Yet among Democrats he is now universally praised. “It’s literally impossible to imagine anyone else doing the job,” says Chris Coons of Delaware.
Unheralded success will do that. Mr Schumer has been credited with coaxing Mr Manchin into line on the $1.9trn stimulus the Democrats passed in March. He is also the architect of a so-far successful bifurcation of infrastructure spending—which some Republicans support—and the rattle-bag of safety net and climate measures that Democrats hope to pass on a partisan basis. Even as this “two-track” process enters what promises to be a stormy last phase of negotiation (which a customary autumnal row over funding the government threatens to make even harder), a large majority of Democrats are firmly behind it.
No one should confuse this with a good way to govern America. Much like Mr Schumer’s something-for-everyone leadership style, the Democrats’ effort to jam a presidential term’s worth of new programmes and reforms into a budget bill is illustrative of their weakness and a broken system. A decade of gridlock suggests there is no other way to make progress on climate change, inequality and other big issues. Yet their approach is nonetheless riddled with shortcomings.
The old saw that bipartisan dealmaking, conducted in good faith, produces better laws still holds. The excesses of the stimulus package compared with the sleeker-looking infrastructure deal illustrate that truth. And Mr Schumer’s light-touch steerage looks like the particular enemy of hard choices. If and when Mr Manchin digs in for a steep reduction in the $3.5trn cost of the draft budget bill, Democrats should drop some of their more expendable schemes—such as free community college—in order to preserve climate and other must-haves. Yet a general hair-cut, which everyone might grumblingly live with, may be more consistent with Mr Schumer’s approach.
It might not get that far. His effort to prolong the negotiation could be storing up an ever more dramatic and damaging blow-out. For that matter, even if the Democrats pass some semblance of their plans, it is not clear that voters would reward them for it.
Virtue’s uncertain reward
Their baggy monster of a budget bill, to borrow Henry James’s phrase, looks too sprawling to be reduced to an effective slogan. The Republican attack on it as socialism would be easier to execute. When working on campaign strategy, Mr Schumer would have had that flaw uppermost in mind. Now consumed by the improbable task of passing laws, he seems unable to. Whatever he may be telling his colleagues, his party cannot have it all.■
