DECISIONS ABOUT medical treatments are usually made in doctors’ offices, not the Victorian splendour of the High Court in London. But in 2020, three judges ruled that children under 16 would be unlikely to be able to consent to one particular medical treatment—the administration of puberty-blocking drugs to those suffering from gender dysphoria, a deep discomfort with one’s sex.
On September 17th the Court of Appeal overturned that ruling, saying that decisions about whether to prescribe puberty-blockers should be left to doctors. The ruling might seem of interest only to specialist medical lawyers. But the legal saga has been watched around the world, for gender dysphoria is a fast-growing diagnosis and the treatments prescribed for it are controversial. Referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), England’s only dedicated youth clinic, have risen from 77 in 2009-10 to 2,383 in 2020-21. Other rich countries have seen similarly sharp rises.

Proponents describe the treatments as life-saving. Sceptics point to the lack of clinical evidence showing that they work, and to worries about severe side-effects later in life. After the original ruling, GIDS suspended puberty-blocker treatments for new patients.
The original case had been brought by Mrs A, the unnamed mother of a child with gender dysphoria, and Keira Bell, a 24-year-old who had been prescribed puberty blockers at GIDS at the age of 16. Ms Bell went on to take cross-sex hormones and to have her breasts surgically removed, only later to regret both decisions. The original ruling referred to the lack of evidence regarding whether puberty blockers actually help alleviate gender dysphoria, and noted that almost all patients prescribed them go on to take cross-sex hormones. These lead to irreversible changes, including the development of cross-sex characteristics such as breasts and beards, and raise the risk of infertility. With all that in mind, the judges ruled that under-16s were unlikely to be able to understand and weigh up the lifelong consequences sufficiently well to consent to taking them.
The Court of Appeal however, decided that the lower court had, in thus venturing into clinical waters, gone beyond its proper remit. Previous case law, it said, had established that decisions about the wisdom or otherwise of medical treatments—even controversial or disputed ones—were best left to doctors. It noted that the original judgment had not found that the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (which runs GIDS) had broken the law, and ruled that the case should have been dismissed as soon as that had been established.
Ms Bell’s supporters hope to appeal to the Supreme Court. But most lawyers seem to think a further appeal would have little chance of success. “I found the Court of Appeal’s judgment a very compelling read,” says one who has followed the case closely. It is unlikely, says another, that the Supreme Court would want to revisit what is widely seen as a settled area of law.
But kicking decisions back to doctors does not mean that the wider argument about puberty blockers is over. Medical opinion in several countries is becoming more cautious. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reviews the scientific underpinning of medical treatments in Britain. In March it said that the standard of evidence for puberty blockers, and for cross-sex hormones prescribed to teenagers, was “very low”. In the same month the prestigious Karolinska Hospital in Sweden cited lack of evidence in its decision to stop prescribing puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to teenagers, except in clinical trials. Finland recently revised its guidelines to prioritise talking therapies over drugs. An NHS review of gender medicine is due to report later this year.
And the Court of Appeal noted that, although medicine is generally best left to doctors, there are limits to their discretion. “Clinicians”, it wrote, “would be alive to the possibility of regulatory or civil action which allows the issue of whether consent has been properly obtained to be tested in individual cases.” The arguments are far from over. ■
