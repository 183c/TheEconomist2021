##### Success will mean walking an electoral tightrope

“THE TRUTH is, this government is picking on a whole set of British people playing to the worst common denominator, which is disgusting.” Boris Johnson “is not a decent prime minister”, but a “bully”. Having wrapped up the Liberal Democrats’ conference on September 20th, Sir Ed Davey, their leader, is not pulling his punches. His criticisms of Mr Johnson are part of an effort to peel off Tories in marginal seats who, he hopes, are repelled by the government’s stance on culture-war issues and angry at its incompetence.
In 2020 Sir Ed became the Lib Dems’ fourth leader in five years. Since their electoral collapse in 2015, the party has been in turmoil. An attempt to regroup by consolidating anti-Brexit voters behind it in 2019 failed. Nine of its 12 MPs have served less than five years. Sir Ed hangs his hopes on two voter groups: liberal Tories turned off by Mr Johnson’s populism and centre-left liberals. These voters are likely to be young graduates, and to say they value diversity and donate to human-rights charities.

Taken together, the two groups could conceivably enable the Liberal Democrats to chip away at the “blue wall”: seats in the south and south-east metropolitan fringe. Their voters are keener on moderate, centrist Toryism, and growing numbers of graduates have moved to such places in the past decade. Lib Dem leaders make much of their party’s surprise by-election victory in June in the formerly safe Tory seat of Chesham and Amersham, two market towns connected to the capital by the last two stops on the Metropolitan tube line.
According to a paper by UK in a Changing Europe, a think-tank, another 33 seats could be within reach. They would require heroic levels of tactical voting, with pretty much all Labour and Green voters consolidating behind the Lib Dems in seats where it is the Tories’ main challenger. Some would also require a swing from the Tories to the Lib Dems of the order of 5%. But the Chesham and Amersham victory gives the party leadership hope.
Sir Ed’s criticisms of Mr Johnson are thus aimed at the ears of “soft Tories” whom he hopes to persuade to defect—as are several of the party’s recent policy decisions. On some subjects, they make Lib Dems sound remarkably like Tory backbenchers. These include housebuilding and vaccine passports (against and against). Sir Ed does his best to describe both stances as consistent with Liberal Democrat traditions of devolved decision-making and opposition to government overreach (they have long opposed identity cards). But the fact that homeowners in leafy shires rarely welcome housing development, and that small businesses oppose vaccine passports, is no coincidence.
Such political cross-dressing brings with it a big risk, however: alienating everyone else who might vote for the party. Most Britons support vaccine passports, and most young people regard building lots more houses as essential if they are ever to be able to afford to own a home. Even trickier may be navigating the culture wars. The party’s new president, Mark Pack, wants to appeal to young liberals by signalling that the party shares their progressive values.
On topics such as Black Lives Matter, where much of the country ended up supporting the English football team’s decision to kneel during the national anthem before matches—and some Conservative culture warriors did not—this is probably good positioning. Trans and gender-identity issues are less clear-cut. Tory voters are on average pretty sceptical. Young Lib Dem activists may have applauded Sir Ed’s insistence during interviews in the run-up to conference that no public spaces should be allowed to remain female-only, not even rape-crisis centres or sporting competitions. But it is unlikely to have done much to persuade potential Tory switchers.
Sir Ed brushes off further questions on the matter. “It seems to be the media that is obsessed with this issue,” he says. Still, says an activist hoping to be selected as a Lib Dem candidate in the next election, it is unlikely to make it into the party’s election materials alongside pledges to improve social care or to reform planning. ■
