###### Toying with the nanny state
# California’s approach to gendered toys says a lot about the state’s political direction 
##### The state is turning micromanaging into an art form

GAVIN NEWSOM, the governor of California, recently signed 770 bills into law that had been approved by the state legislature in Sacramento. The one drawing most attention, rightly, is a law that will expand the number of units that can be built on single-family plots and offer a much-needed boost to housing supply. Rick Rivas of Govern for California, a good-governance group, calls it the “most consequential housing bill over the last decade”.
Less noticed is a new law taking aim at child’s play. Starting in 2024, large retailers with more than 500 employees will no longer be permitted to offer just “boy” and “girl” sections for toys and other child-care items in their stores. They must also add a “gender-neutral” section. Supporters say the new law will help combat gender stereotypes, while opponents see this as government overreach. Showing Barbie dolls only to girls and trucks only to boys is about as passé as giving someone a Mr Potato Head (which earlier this year dropped the “mister” and rebranded itself as “Potato Head” to be more inclusive). But should it be government’s role to tell businesses how to display such merchandise?

Sherry Jeffe, a political analyst, says that the new toys law shows that California is intent on managing “minute” issues “down to a level I never thought it would go, in regards to state-level involvement”. Another example of the state’s micro-management, also recently signed into law, bans restaurants from distributing single-use condiments, such as ketchup and soy-sauce, to customers unless requested. Mr Newsom also signed a new law requiring public universities and schools to offer menstrual supplies on campus.
With Democrats holding a super-majority in the state legislature and control of all state-level elected offices, it may come as no surprise that politicians are using their power to advance issues their party cares about, such as gender equality. Mr Newsom, who defeated a recent campaign to recall him from office by a wide margin, is more concerned about criticism from the left than from marginalised Republicans. He is governing accordingly.
However, while the new toys law may be mostly symbolic, it points to how California is becoming more involved in businesses’ and people’s daily lives. This is just the beginning, says Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at Stanford. As the state pushes forward with its efforts to combat climate change, “there is probably no dimension of life that will be untouched by California’s decarbonisation agenda”, he says. For example, Mr Newsom recently signed a law banning the sale of new gas-powered leaf-blowers and lawnmowers. Last year he signed an executive order banning the sale of gas-powered cars from 2035. Some cities are even talking about banning the use of natural gas in new homes and businesses, a measure which would, in effect, bar gas stoves.
California may be taking the most draconian actions on climate change, but it is not alone in using laws to “advance a cultural agenda”, says Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank. He draws a connection between the toys law and red-state governors, including Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida, who are forbidding companies to require employees to wear masks and get vaccinated. By doing so, Texas and Florida are interfering with the freedom of businesses to decide their own policies. Recent efforts in Texas to halt nearly all abortions serve as another example of government interference in the name of a social agenda. According to Mr Cain of Stanford, “It’s not like one party is for freedom and the other isn’t. Both parties are for different forms of intrusion.”
