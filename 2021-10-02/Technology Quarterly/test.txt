It will also be helped by filling in some of the gaps in the current food system: things overlooked until an entrepreneurial eye coupled to an appropriate technology sees what could be made of them. Fishing and agriculture tend to be seasonal, leaving workers with time and unused machinery for part of each year that, with imagination, can find alternative employment.

This makes insect farming controversial to some, who see it as propping up the cruelties and slaughter of the intensive poultry and livestock business. But from an ecosystem point of view it may be helpful. A rich protein source that does not require large-scale arable farming or lots of water—as soybeans do—may have a lower overall burden, especially if it is largely fed on waste. Replacing fishmeal is particularly appealing. Farmed salmon is often fed with fishmeal made from other species, disrupting the open-ocean food chain. Highly productive insect farms could be a way to turn food waste into fresh fish, which seems greatly preferable.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"In time insects may become the sought-after delicacies Mr Crowley would like.

They may be astounded at fruits and vegetables sourced from far away, rather than coming—as all the finest produce does—from a farm just a few floors below the restaurant. They may shudder at the risks of eating line-caught fish, or grow envious at the idea of a world where the climate allowed coffee to come from beans grown on hillsides, rather than from yeast which still doesn’t quite get the flavonoids right despite a century of genetic tinkering.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Some will deem the cruelty and environmental damage done by their ancestors’ diets unimaginable and unforgivable.
