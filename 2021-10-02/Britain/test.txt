He used his background (a factory-worker father and a mother with a rare, and awful, type of inflammatory arthritis) to lay claim to traditional values such as hard work and aspiration, as well as to more obviously left-wing values such as care and community. He praised the armed forces for defending the country, and the Crown Prosecution Service (which he ran from 2008 to 2013) for tackling criminals. He also praised Tony Blair, the Labour prime minister the Labour left loves to hate, for delivering the “levelling up” that the Tories only talk about.

They are offering similar policies: higher taxes and bigger government. But Sir Keir’s seriousness and centre-left values may be more suited than Mr Johnson’s bluster to darkening times. The winds of political change have blown left-of-centre parties into power in two of the West’s biggest countries, America and Germany.
