FOR NEAR ON nine minutes, George Holliday stood outside his second-floor windows with his three-pound Sony Handycam clamped to his eye. It was somewhere round one in the morning on March 3rd 1991. He and his wife Maria had been woken from deep sleep by the clatter of a helicopter low over their apartment in Lake View Terrace in north Los Angeles, and the sirens of police cars. His first thought, hearing all that, was to grab the camera.
The Handycam was new, a Valentine’s gift for Maria which would give them both fun. Already he’d caught some of the filming of “Terminator 2” in the biker bar across the street, the scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger came in naked, stole a biker’s clothes and took off on his Harley. That was on the same tape he was using to capture the ruckus outside, and later on he was going to film a friend running in a marathon. It certainly livened his plumber’s life, working his butt off crawling under houses and unclogging drains. He wanted to film everything now.

It was tricky to do, since he was still learning. He couldn’t get the autofocus to work in the dark, and there were two bits where the tape was blurry, especially at the start. That might not have mattered, except that this video became the crucial piece of evidence in a police trial that convulsed the city of Los Angeles and shocked the world—nine minutes in which the everyday mistreatment of American blacks by the police was, for the first time, laid bare in a citizen recording for everyone to see.
His video, starting a bit late, showed a group of white officers who had stopped a car. Four of them approached the driver, later identified as Rodney King, a black man on parole for a robbery. He had been driving wildly with alcohol in his blood. In the first 81 seconds of the video the officers beat and kicked King, on whatever part of his body they could hit, 56 times. King kept trying to get up, then falling down again under the blows, until in the end the officers handcuffed him and threw a white sheet over his face as if he was dead. He almost was, with 11 fractures of the skull.
Mr Holliday, filming, had mixed thoughts. He had spent almost all his young life in Argentina, where his British father had worked for Shell Oil. There the police often took matters brutally into their own hands. But in America, which a friend had enticed him to move to in 1980, he believed they were generally kind. If they stomped and hit someone, so fiercely that he picked up the whack of their batons, they must have some good reason. But what could the guy have done to deserve such a beating as that?
The LAPD would not tell him, and at first showed no interest in the tape. But he and Maria both thought it should be seen. The local KTLA TV channel took it, cagily at first, and ran it on the news that evening. But then they shared it with CNN, and his world exploded. He opened the door on a sea of reporters, so that he could hardly get to work. His phone rang off the hook. Everyone wanted copies of the tape, but he had no equipment to make them. Instead he had left the master-tape with KTLA, for just $500, and soon enough higher authorities took it away and kept it.
In 1992 the officers were tried and, despite his video, acquitted of assault. The southern section of Los Angeles went up in flames then for almost a week, with more than 60 dead and $1bn-worth of damage. And, having been a five-minute hero, he got the rap now for sharing the tape. Even in Lake View Terrace, a quiet, horsey, middle-class place which saw no riots, his customers blamed him, and death-threats were stuck on the windshield of his van.
For he was still a plumber, though freelance to avoid hassle, still scraping round at the back of sinks and fitting new pipes to boilers. So much for the TV show, the biopic and the George Holliday crime-fighting toy, none of which happened. An expensive lawyer failed to get his tape back from the FBI, so he lost Arnie and the marathon too, and though he owned the broadcast rights they did not earn him much. In 2020 he put his camera up for auction for $225,000 to buy a new place, but it drew no bids.
It seemed wrong that he couldn’t make money from this. When Abraham Zapruder’s sightseeing ciné film was seized by the government after Kennedy’s assassination, his family was paid $16m. King, too, after a second trial had found two officers guilty of civil-rights violations, got $3.8m from a civil suit against the city. He met King once as he filled up at a petrol station, not recognising him with his face smoothed out again. King thanked him for saving his life, and they shook hands.
Saving a life was surely something to be proud of, and a beating like that was out of line. So he did not regret that he had made the tape. But it cost him his marriage, in fact two marriages, for more or less nothing. It gave the LAPD a very bad rap, one he felt they didn’t deserve. And he couldn’t understand, being a plumber and not into politics, why race was always such a big thing. Surely it didn’t matter what colour anyone’s skin was? As King himself said, couldn’t they all just get along?
For the media he had no respect. They had twisted his words into their own story, making him say what he hadn’t said. Only the videotape spoke true and couldn’t be argued with. He no longer bothered to watch the news, which was spun to the left or the right, but picked up talk-radio news as he drove from job to job.
He heard, therefore, in 2020, about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But he did not see the video almost all America saw, on which, three decades after he had rushed out on his balcony, another citizen-recorder, one of legions now, filmed a white police officer forcing the life from an unarmed black suspect for near on nine minutes. Again. Still. ■
