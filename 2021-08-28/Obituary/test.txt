The world contained thousands of paintings that looked, in a murky way, like Rembrandts. Weeding out the copies and fakes and authenticating the originals was meant to be a ten-year task for him and his small band of art-historian colleagues. It took nearly five times as long, and several fallings-out, to get to the sixth and final volume of the “Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings”—by which time the number of authenticated Rembrandts had fallen from 624 (Bredius’s estimate in 1935) to 340, including 70 he had reinstated all by himself.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"This caused alarm and confusion among curators, but also brought him a surge of fame.

It took Mr van de Wetering, armed with his knowledge of how Rembrandt approached the very act of painting, to uncover the marks of an authentic piece. He found, for example, a “defect” in Rembrandt’s technique that caused his brush to make breaks when he was painting people’s curls. Other clues, however, showed cleverness. Smudging the contours of his figures caused their faces to loom from the dark. Making the men’s collars grey, rather than white, in “The anatomy lesson of Dr Tulp”, emphasised both the body on the slab and the thickness of the air. Blurring Anna’s hand and spinning wheel in “Tobit and Anna” boldly suggested continuous movement. Painting that seemed rough was in fact meticulous and magical.

It was harder, though, to track his thinking. The master loved certain themes and kept returning to them, evidently because they would sell and he had to make a living; but sometimes, as in his various versions of “The supper at Emmaus”, to kindle devotion in the viewer. He found light in rooms a constant challenge, agonising over windows, shadows and reflections and even, in a late self-portrait, altering his cap from white to brown to change the daylight’s flow. If his pursuer had to sum him up in a word, it was “searching”. Rembrandt was never still, making artistic explosions one after another, soaring past the rules of art that prevailed in 17th-century Europe and striving to get “the greatest and most natural effect of movement”, as he wrote once, in bodies and in souls.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Mr van de Wetering did not imagine he had really plumbed that mind.
