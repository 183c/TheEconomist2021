In 1971 Linda Nochlin, an art historian, published a groundbreaking essay, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?”, which investigated how creative women had been thwarted for centuries. Ms Chicago threw herself into creating female-focused spaces and works, reasoning that if the art world was hostile to women, they would have to develop an alternative “art infrastructure” that included “establishing our own art history”.

For several years supporters arranged to show it at venues around the world. But then the installation was packed away. Ms Chicago returned to her studio, her career sputtering.
