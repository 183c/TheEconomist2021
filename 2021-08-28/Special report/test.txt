An Iraqi-born singer performed songs by Umm Kulthum, Egypt’s most famous diva. “The Lady” was an icon of Arab nationalism: a champion of the Palestinian cause and friend of Nasser, who often scheduled his speeches to follow her monthly concerts. On this evening the mostly Lebanese crowd was drawn from a mix of sects and classes.

Yet America’s place in the region—measured in troop levels, diplomatic engagement or influence—is not what it was.

Russia and China look out only for their own narrow interests. Yet outsiders still loom large in the popular imagination. Indeed, there is an odd nostalgia for a time when they were more active.
