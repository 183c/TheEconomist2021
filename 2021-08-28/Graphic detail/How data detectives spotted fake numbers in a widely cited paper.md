# How data detectives spotted fake numbers in a widely cited paper 
##### Everyone accepts that the data were fabricated. No one admits to forging them

IF YOU WRITE a book called “The Honest Truth About Dishonesty”, the last thing you want to be linked to is fake data. Yet a paper by Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University, seems to be based on just that.
In 2012 Mr Ariely, Max Bazerman, Francesca Gino, Nina Mazar and Lisa Shu wrote a paper arguing that people act more honestly when they state in advance that they will be truthful. It cited two studies from a lab, and one based on car-insurance data.

On August 17th Leif Nelson, Joe Simmons and Uri Simonsohn, who run Data Colada, a blog, wrote that they believed the insurance data were fake. All of the paper’s authors asked for the study to be retracted. They all deny responsibility, saying that they were duped rather than dishonest.
The study had car-insurance customers list how much they had driven, and sign a statement saying they were being truthful. Half signed at the top of the form, half at the bottom. The first group listed 10% more miles, possibly raising their premiums.


Data Colada found three smoking guns. First, the dodgy data look different. The spreadsheet contains 6,744 values in Cambria font. Each has a twin in Calibri, identical save for small gaps in mileage. This implies that the forgers duplicated real data, added random variation and forgot to cover their tracks. Next, the distribution of miles is not bell-shaped, like most real data, but resembles a box. Similar numbers of cars drove each distance below 50,000; none exceeded that amount. And the data are too precise. The reported starting mileages are often rounded to powers of ten. Yet in the distances under study, zero is no more common than other final digits, a hallmark of machine-generated data.


Who is responsible? Mr Bazerman, Ms Gino and Ms Shu say they worked only on the lab studies. Ms Mazar says that she reviewed the car data, but had no role in acquiring them. Mr Ariely says he was the only author to deal with the source of the data, though he did not name it. He says they must have been faked before he saw them.
One potential explanation is that workers at the insurer forged the numbers. The Hartford, an insurer, says it worked with Mr Ariely on “a small project” in 2007-08, but cannot “locate any data, deliverables or results”. It says that most of the employees involved have left. None of Mr Ariely’s co-authors granted us interviews. “I did not fabricate the data,” Mr Ariely says. “I am willing to do a lie-detection test on that.”■
