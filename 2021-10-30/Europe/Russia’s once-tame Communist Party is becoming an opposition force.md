EKATERINA ENGALYCHEVA never got her badge showing Lenin as a child. The week she was supposed to join the Oktiabriata (“little Octobrists”, a reference to the revolution of 1917), as all Soviet children did at the age of seven, the Soviet Union fell apart. But 30 years later Ms Engalycheva is a member of the Communist Party and a Moscow city councillor. She campaigns against Vladimir Putin’s crony capitalism; Lenin would no doubt have approved. But he would have been horrified by her other demands: for fair elections and impartial justice. She has been detained and fined for protesting against the jailing of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader, and recently had to barricade herself in her office while police waited outside to arrest her.
She is far from the stereotype of a Communist. She is not a red-flag-waving pensioner, and does not care about Stalin. Nor does she feel any attachment to the Soviet-era Communists who “betrayed our country and our people, switched sides and settled in United Russia” (the vehicle through which Mr Putin now controls the Russian parliament). She is not bothered that the Communist Party today is led by Gennady Zyuganov, a Stalin-praising former Soviet ideologue. What matters more to her is that the party is showing signs of becoming a genuine opposition. And this is making the Kremlin, and indeed Mr Zyuganov himself, nervous.

Mr Zyuganov founded his post-Soviet Communist Party in 1993, aiming to benefit from some of the resentment and nostalgia brought on by the Soviet Union’s collapse. It was in fact a nationalist and imperialist party, which that year was involved in an unsuccessful armed revolt against Boris Yeltsin’s democratic government. In 1996, when Mr Zyuganov challenged Yeltsin in presidential elections, Russian liberals and businessmen, fearful of a Communist revanche, threw all their resources behind the ailing president. “I would rather elect a dead Yeltsin than a live Zyuganov,” one TV executive said at the time.
Mr Zyuganov lost, but for the next two decades his presence allowed the Kremlin to frame politics as a binary choice between democracy and Soviet-style communism. Today many Russian democrats, desperate to get Yeltsin’s successor out of the Kremlin, find themselves voting for the Communists.
They are well aware of the irony. But, as Yevgenia Albats, a firebrand of Russia’s opposition media, says, “this bitch of a government has left us no choice.” With nearly all forms of politics banned and Mr Navalny behind bars, the Communist Party has become the main beneficiary of his “smart voting” strategy. He urged Russians to vote for whichever candidate was best placed to beat United Russia’s. Had the votes been counted honestly in parliamentary elections in September, the Communists would have got roughly the same number as United Russia. Even after all the rigging it won 19% of the vote, up from 13% in 2016.
This success has discombobulated Mr Zyuganov. Financed and controlled by the Kremlin, he has enrolled his party in Mr Putin’s system of “managed democracy”, which presents an illusion of choice while reinforcing the Kremlin’s control. “Smart voting” has spoiled that game. Not only did it boost the Communist vote, it gave its younger deputies a sense of power.
It is not only protest votes that are buoying the Communist Party. Several young politicians running on the party’s ticket are using it as a platform from which to launch their own left-wing agenda. Many of them would fit comfortably into a European-style social democratic party.
Consider Mikhail Lobanov, a 37-year-old maths lecturer at Moscow State University. He ran a Western-style campaign, crowdfunding and canvassing door-to-door, in a relatively affluent part of Moscow. He ditched ideological clichés to focus on urban activism and social welfare. “I believe in the left idea as a way of restraining the excesses of capitalism through equal opportunities and access to universal health care and education,” he says. The Kremlin’s blatant rigging robbed him of victory, but not of his appeal.
With leftism advancing in much of the rest of the world, it is striking how long it has taken to come into vogue in Russia, particularly given the inequality that Mr Putin’s rule has entrenched. An obvious explanation is that it takes time for people to forget the Soviet attempt to enforce equality, the millions who were murdered in its pursuit, and how catastrophically it failed. Now, however, six years of falling incomes have prompted many Russians to reconsider the politics of the left.
The Communists’ current shift is largely a reaction to Mr Putin’s policies. By annexing Crimea in 2014 he stole the party’s previous nationalist agenda, leaving it to make a choice, explains Gregory Yudin, a sociologist. “They could either move further to the right and become extinct, or they could step out of their ghetto and shift to the left.”
Valery Rashkin, a Communist MP and head of the party’s Moscow branch, decided to experiment. At the September election he backed a number of young candidates such as Evgeny Stupin, a 38-year-old former police investigator who had served in the Urals but quit his badly paid job (along with the obligatory membership of United Russia) and moved to Moscow to look for work. The injustice and corruption that he encountered there led Mr Stupin to the Communists.
The Kremlin is now directing Soviet-style repression against young Communists, and trying to paint them as Stalinists. Meanwhile, the Communists are standing up for human rights, for example by demanding investigations into reported torture in Russia’s prisons. Mr Putin’s Russia is indeed a looking-glass world. ■
