Economist"],"url":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/13/according-to-twitter-twitters-algorithm-favours-conservatives","type":"Article","articleBody":"Among the most hotly debated   questions on social media is how algorithmic bias affects social media. In   America conservatives claim that Facebook and Twitter bury or outright censor   their views. The left retorts that right-wing conspiracy theories like QAnon   flourish on these sites. \n   An unlikely arbiter recently emerged in this debate: Twitter itself. In   October it released a paper showing that its algorithm, which picks which   tweets users see in which order, favoured right-leaning American news sites.   In six of the seven countries studied, the algorithm also gave a   disproportionate boost to lawmakers from conservative political parties.   Twitter shared its data with The Economist this month, letting us   test the authors’ claims. \n\n   The study relied on a large experiment. Until 2016 users saw tweets only from   accounts they followed, shown in reverse chronological order. After launching   its algorithm, Twitter kept 1% of users in the old system. This let it measure   how often its algorithm served up certain tweets, compared with the   “reverse-chron” method. \n   In April-August 2020 the authors used this approach on 3,634 accounts   belonging to legislators from 32 political parties. Although they did not   detect political bias in the treatment of individual lawmakers, they did find   a slant when grouping accounts by party. In all countries but Germany, the   algorithm’s “amplification ratio” was lower for members of leftist parties   than for members of right-wing ones. \n   This discrepancy could arise for reasons besides ideology. To test   alternatives, we fed Twitter’s data into a model that accounted for the amount   of amplification in each country, political parties’ vote shares in the most   recent elections and whether they were in government. Yet even after making   these adjustments, the algorithm still favoured conservative parties. \n   In contrast, the evidence for bias aiding right-wing American media seemed   less robust. The algorithm did give extra amplification to news sources that   independent groups like Ad Fontes Media classify as conservative. However,   ideology and accuracy (which Ad Fontes, among others, also scores) are   correlated to each other. And among the sites studied, those with the   strictest sourcing and fact-checking also tended to have left-of-centre   politics. \n  \n\n   In 2019 we studied how Google ranks news stories, and found that accuracy, not   ideology, explained its rankings. This is also true of Twitter. However,   whereas Google gave higher rankings to more reliable sites, we found that   Twitter boosted the least reliable sources, regardless of their politics.   Left-wing sites with poor accuracy scores, like tmz, were   amplified more than credible, conservative ones like the   Wall Street Journal. ProPublica, a non-profit focused on   public-interest investigations, had one of the lowest amplification ratios. \n   Because Twitter did not share the tweets it studied, we could not identify the   type of content that its algorithm rewards. But if the company wants to reduce   misinformation on its site, making tweaks to favour rigorous reporting might   help.■ \n  Sources: “Algorithmic Amplification of Politics on Twitter”, by Ferenc Huszár  et al.; Ad Fontes Media; Media Bias/Fact Check; NewsGuard","description":"Their data show a bias aiding unreliable media, regardless of ideology, and right-wing political parties","articleDescription":"Their data show a bias aiding unreliable media, regardless of ideology, and right-wing political parties","imageUrl":"https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20211113_GDP110.jpg","imageHeight":720,"imageWidth":1280,"datePublished":"2021-11-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-11-11T16:23:49Z","dateCreated":"2021-11-10T22:03:10Z","isPrintArticle":true,"printEdition":"2021-11-13T00:00:00Z","copyrightYear":2021,"dateline":"","inLanguage":"en","interactive":true,"scripts":["https://infographics.economist.com1"],"css":[]}},[],{"shouldDropPaywall":false},{"section1":{"id":"/content/md2otnsr4fvud5kbahk8m3ktoif2fs2i","type":["Blog"],"headline":"The Economist explains","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"What is executive privilege?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/10/what-is-executive-privilege","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_USP502.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":3685,"height":2085},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"Will Singles’ Day, China’s Black Friday, be different this year?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/10/will-singles-day-chinas-black-friday-be-different-this-year","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_BLP513.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"What is happening on the Poland-Belarus border?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/09/what-is-happening-on-the-poland-belarus-border","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_EUP503.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":3072,"height":1738},"__typename":"Media"}}],"__typename":"HasPart"}},"section2":{"id":"/content/omi23dr8h15h8c33t2gkb2cju8ap758o","type":["Blog"],"headline":"Podcasts","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"Is a university degree still worth it?","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/11/11/is-a-university-degree-still-worth-it","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_PDP511.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"“More than half the Russian population now live in fear of the state”—Putin’s increasing repression","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/11/11/more-than-half-the-russian-population-now-live-in-fear-of-the-state-putins-increasing-repression","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_PDP509.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}},{"headline":"It’s not just Evergrande—unearthing the rot in China’s financial system","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/11/10/its-not-just-evergrande-unearthing-the-rot-in-chinas-financial-system","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","image":{"main":{"url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20211113_PDP508.jpg","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","width":1280,"height":720},"__typename":"Media"}}],"__typename":"HasPart"}},"section3":{"id":"/content/lt4151741raqm0fi11oq7iur88ea2iko","type":["Chapter"],"headline":"1843 magazine","url":{"canonical":"https://www.economist.com/1843","__typename":"URL"},"__typename":"Content","hasPart":{"parts":[{"headline":"Two environmentalists sabotaged an oil pipeline in America.
