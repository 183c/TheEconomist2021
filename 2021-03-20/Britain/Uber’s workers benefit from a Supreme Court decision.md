WHEN THE Supreme Court ruled last month that Uber drivers were workers employed by the firm rather than self-employed contractors, nobody knew how the company would react. In California, faced with a similar decision, it fought tooth and nail, and in effect got the judgment reversed through a ballot initiative. In Britain, many had expected it to ignore the court’s ruling on the ground that it applied only to a small group of workers, and to conditions that no longer prevailed.

Instead, Uber made a handbrake turn, announcing on March 16th that its 70,000 drivers will be paid at least the minimum wage, get a pension and receive holiday pay. The Economist understands that the company will contact current and former drivers to offer them cash payments in lieu of holiday pay for the time they have worked for the firm.


The dispute reflects the messy nature of British employment rules. “Employees” gain access to the full gamut of employment-law protections; “workers” get some protections but can be dismissed at will; the self-employed are taxed more lightly but receive few legal rights. Clarifying definitions has relied on case law and usually boils down to arguments about the degree of control exercised by employers. It’s a slow business: the case that ended up in the Supreme Court started five years ago in an employment tribunal.

The gig economy has driven a rise in self-employment. While many workers welcome the flexibility, others would prefer the protections that come with traditional employment, but cannot get them. The government commissioned a review of the framework by Matthew Taylor, which was published in 2017 but its call to strengthen workers’ rights was ignored.

Mr Taylor, who calls the lack of progress “deeply disappointing”, reckons that the government understands that change is needed but does not want to be seen to be increasing burdens on business. The Treasury, with its eyes on the revenues that could be raised by taxing the self-employed at similar rates to employees, has supported reform, but a modest attempt to equalise the tax burden in 2017 prompted fierce resistance from Tory MPs.

Now it looks as though a combination of the judiciary and the market may improve conditions in the gig economy. Uber’s new package for drivers goes beyond what many campaigners had expected. The firm hopes that its retrospective, across-the-board decision will not only see off potential new litigation but also make it a more attractive employer than rivals such as Bolt and Ola ahead of what is set to be a busy summer as the economy reopens. More legal skirmishing lies ahead over the definitions of what time should be counted for calculating minimum-wage payments. But Uber is seeking to turn a legal defeat into a strategic opportunity.

The Supreme Court ruling will encourage people in other sectors ranging from social care to construction to argue that they too are workers. That will take time, though others may follow where Uber has led. A firm that prides itself on having disrupted urban transport may now disrupt the gig economy.■
