E-taxes
Mike Godwin's law of Nazi analogies states that as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one. A corollary adage might be that as an economic discussion grows longer, the probability of creating a new form of taxation approaches one. Your leader on the rise of e-money violated this proper economic discussion by creating no new tax (“”, May 8th). In fact, tax got no mention at all.

You summed up well the positive aspects of central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Yet government-issued fiat currencies are deeply entwined with tax (fiat currencies are arguably just tax credits). CBDCs provide new tax-collection powers. Complex taxation algorithms can be applied to any CBDC transaction in real time. Once people realise the power of CBDC systems to support various taxation initiatives at low transaction costs, we should expect avalanches of proposals: town taxes, child-noise taxes, sugar taxes, alcohol-consumption taxes, foreign-visitor taxes, and so on.
In 2016 I gave an example of such a CBDC-based tax to the House of Lords. Given widespread sentiment that London is too overweening, imagine a populist redistribution tax whereby transaction taxes rise in wealthy districts. To bring about levelling up, politicians increase the taxation rate as you approach Trafalgar Square, up to 99.9% beside Nelson’s Column, or spend your money in the Outer Hebrides at 0.1% tax. Technology cuts two ways.

Some countries, such as Australia, have already digitalised their currency independently of their central bank. Since 2013 most Australians have opened cost-free myGov accounts that can be operated from their mobile phones. The government also issues cost-free debit cards linked to their myGov to make payments. As a result many people on welfare no longer need a bank account.

How worrying to read your article on govcoins in the same week that an important oil pipeline was shut by a cyber-attack. One cannot even fathom the effect of such an attack on a digital currency issued by a central bank, an event that would immediately freeze all financial activity, from corporate transactions to buying groceries.

Your  mentioned whaling “sloops” that sailed out of Nantucket (May 8th). A sloop is a vessel designed for speed. Whaling vessels of the 1800s, especially from Nantucket, were more likely to be brigs, brigantines, or ship-rigged with multiple masts and wide hulls to hold supplies and whale oil for a three- or four-year voyage. Only the Native American tribes of the Pacific north-west or Alaska would venture out in a narrow hull to go whaling, which those “coarse” sailors from New England would think to be foolhardy.

Technology and China
You reported on the important role of the American government’s Bureau of Industry and Security in writing the rules on trade in technology with China (“”, May 8th). It is misguided, however, to suggest that the appointment of an “outsider” to lead the BIS would indicate a lack of a “real plan” on China. The agency is responsible for ensuring that sensitive technologies do not reach adversaries that would use them for harm. That is an increasingly challenging job, especially as China has blurred the line between the private sector, government and the army.
The Trump administration added some 330 Chinese government-aligned companies to the Entity List. The Biden administration has added another seven to that blacklist, signalling a continuation of the policy against the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy. The true test of whether this administration has a “real plan” on China will be whether Joe Biden’s nominee understands its ambitions to steal and exploit American-made technology and is willing to put the United States’ long-term national-security interests ahead of short-term corporate profits. It is not relevant whether the nominee has a legal credential, is an outsider, or is a Washington veteran.
The appointment should be made on substance, capability and an understanding of the issues and the stakes—not whether an individual fits the mould of a bureaucrat.

Jackson, Wyoming
column (May 15th) on Liz Cheney’s political demise was excellent, and I share Ms Cheney’s concerns about Donald Trump’s detrimental impact on democracy. However, as a proud Wyomingite, I still resent Ms Cheney for committing one cardinal sin against the people of Wyoming: she moved to Jackson.
You have to understand Wyoming's small-scale geopolitics to understand this. As a former governor said, the state is just one small town with long streets between neighbours. Most of it is rural, desolate and windy. Small communities rely on drilling, mining and ranching to survive. We are interconnected at the State Fair, county rodeos and high-school sporting events. We all know someone from Cheyenne, Cody, Gillette, Laramie and Sheridan, as well as the even smaller towns in between.
The one exception is Jackson. Jackson is a beautiful, expensive playground for the coastal elite. Jackson is insular. Jackson does not interact with the economy in the rest of the state. Most Wyomingites don't identify with Jackson. Its elitism is foreign to us. We spend our vacations in the Wind River and Big Horn mountain ranges.
I still question why Ms Cheney decided to move there. When she was elected to Congress she was characterised as a carpetbagger. Yet, in the words of my father, you could be born in Jackson and still be a carpetbagger. She could have moved to Cody or Sheridan.
I anticipate that Ms Cheney's popularity will keep declining in Wyoming; she will continue to be portrayed as an east-coast elitist who is out of touch with the state. I laud her courage in opposing Trumpism. I still can't forgive her for moving to Jackson.

Slapshot
The casual reference to “America’s National Hockey League” in “” (May 15th) must have caused your Canadian readers to choke on their Labatt beer. The NHL was founded in Canada and the nation referenced in the name is Canada. Sadly, however, Canadians have long lost control of their national sport, with 24 of the 31 NHL teams located in America.
Adding insult to injury, many of the newer teams are located in southern cities such as Tampa, Las Vegas or Anaheim that rarely, if ever, see natural ice.
