MILLIONS OF AFGHANS tuned in to Tolo, a local broadcaster, to watch an interview on August 20th with Malala Yousafzai, a campaigner for girls’ education who won the Nobel peace prize after the Pakistani Taliban shot her in the head and nearly killed her. Soon afterwards an Afghan Taliban spokesman visited Tolo’s offices in Kabul for a two-hour discussion on the media and women’s rights. Rather than complain or issue threats, he promised that the new government would respect the freedom of the press.
A few days earlier, another spokesman was interviewed on Tolo by a female anchor, a first for the Islamists. At press conferences the Taliban’s officials have answered tough questions (“Have the Afghan people forgiven you?”) that might get a journalist in Saudi Arabia thrown out of the room. The Taliban say they have mellowed since the last time they were in power. Their initial tolerance of Afghan television is part of a campaign to persuade the world they mean it.

The Taliban, like any half-competent political outfit, are skilled in using social media. That helps them reach an international audience. But the group’s approach to commercial television will play a bigger role in influencing how Afghans see their new government. When the Taliban ruled the country in the late 1990s, they attempted to ban TV and went around smashing Afghans’ sets. To do the same today would be politically costly. Tolo, the country’s leading broadcaster, was set up in 2004. There are now more than 200 local and international TV channels, with programming covering the gamut from cooking contests and game shows to Islamic education and sports. Many Afghans have no experience of life without mass media.
Nearly 70% of Afghans watch TV, according to a survey by the Asia Foundation, a non-profit, in 2019, whereas only 30% have internet access. Prime-time shows can attract 10m-12m viewers, more than a quarter of the population. Far more people voted last year in the finals of “Afghan Star”, a music competition (pictured) resembling “American Idol”, than in the national election. “There is nothing else to do,” says Saad Mohseni, Tolo’s boss. “People all gather round the TV and discuss the shows for hours. It’s like the United States in the ’50s.” And unlike social media, which often isolate users in ideological bubbles, Afghan TV is mostly a moderating force.
In 2008 the government attempted to ban a popular Indian soap opera, “Because the Mother-in-Law Was Once the Daughter-in-Law”, which the culture minister considered too racy. Fans were outraged. Tolo fought the ban in court and the government backed down. It also backed down that year in a tussle with another popular broadcaster, Ariana Television Network, after detaining the host of an investigative programme for criticising the performance of two government ministers.
While Tolo has stood its ground on news, it has made some concessions on its entertainment programming. In anticipation of more puritanical rules, the channel has stopped airing two Turkish soap operas, as well as shows that feature singing. It has filled the time by doubling the length of the 6pm news broadcast to an hour and by showing cricket matches and a historical series about the Ottoman Empire.
Many Afghans think the Taliban will gradually tighten the reins. The female presenter who interviewed a Taliban spokesman has fled. Taliban footsoldiers recently beat up a Tolo journalist and a cameraman. Yet if the Taliban make television dull and conservative, or ban it altogether, they will alienate a huge proportion of Afghans and also lose a means to influence them. What is more, censoring or outlawing television would undermine their campaign to convince the world that they have joined the 21st century—or at least the 20th.
