The first was the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, a declaration of American primacy in the western hemisphere that arguably still pertains. The second was the Truman Doctrine, whereby America shouldered responsibility for containing the Soviet Union.

Many so-called doctrines also mistake presidential aspirations for outcomes. Mr Obama was mostly concerned with avoiding the mistakes of his predecessor. Mr Trump’s nativism was less of a guide to his foreign policy than his zeal to undo whatever Mr Obama had done.

But it has clearly propagated a misleading notion of presidential power. Far from being the untrammelled “decider-in-chief” that George W. Bush briefly was after 9/11, presidents tend to be almost as bound by public opinion in foreign affairs as they are at home. Thus, Franklin Roosevelt moved from isolationism towards engagement as his majorities increased.

It therefore falls to Mr Biden, a longtime foreign-policy bungler yet arguably the first grown-up president of the post-unipolar age, to construct an appropriately weighty response. Containment cannot be his guide. Climate change and economic integration call for much more co-operation between the rival powers than occurred during the cold war.
