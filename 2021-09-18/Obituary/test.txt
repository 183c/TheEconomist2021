Chios, the island where he was born, had a reputation for courage and adventurism. His mother grew up in the Greek colony in Asia Minor, his father’s family on Crete, each the source of very different folk traditions. The elder Theodorakis was an official in the Ministry of the Interior, so the family moved around the country often, exposing young Mikis to different musical influences. At seven in Ioannina he learned to sing Byzantine hymns; at ten in Argostoli, a town of 7,000 people and one piano, the bishop asked him to perform the Passion in church on Good Friday. Later, in Patras, he was given a violin and an accordion. He formed a band and wrote his first compositions. In his teens he directed a choir, assembled an orchestra and gave the first concert at which his Byzantine ode, “Kasiani”, was played. In his 20s, during the Greek civil war, when he was imprisoned and tortured for being a communist, he saw friends killed and dedicated his symphonic work, “Elegy of Zanos and Karlis”, to two victims of the fratricidal conflict.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"With the advent of peace he left Greece at last in the early 1950s, winning a bursary to study counterpoint and musical analysis under Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire.

The “New Wave” was coined to describe how cinema was changing, but music and dance were also part of the great post-war renewal. And he might well have stayed at the centre of it, had he not noticed, one evening at Covent Garden in London, quite how viscerally the audience responded to the Byzantine hymns he had woven into the music for his ballet “Antigone”.
