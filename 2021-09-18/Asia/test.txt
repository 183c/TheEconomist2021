More recently Canberra insisted on overseeing Australia’s vaccine rollout but failed to lay on sufficient supplies. It struggled to get what jabs it had into arms after blocking state health authorities from taking the lead.

A new “national cabinet” that includes state premiers has been formed to co-ordinate the response.

It is shut off from its huge diaspora and it has halted the immigration on which the country was built. A “fortress Australia”, anxious about the world and inclined to throw up barriers against it, is, as Mr Fullilove warns, a smaller Australia.
