 raged on, despite the scrapping of an unpopular tax reform that had sparked them and the resignation of the finance minister who championed it. The government responded harshly; the protesters became increasingly violent in turn. At least 24 people have died and more than 800 civilians and police officers have been injured.
, once again displayed his authoritarian tendencies. The legislative assembly, which his party controls, sacked five Supreme Court judges and the attorney-general. Their replacements have links to Mr Bukele, who now controls all three branches of the state. American officials complained, but softly. President Joe Biden’s administration wants Central American governments to help it curb migration to the United States.

For the first time since 2005 members of the opposition in Venezuela were allowed onto the National Electoral Council. Nicolás Maduro, the dictator, wants to persuade the United States that his regime no longer deserves the sanctions imposed on it.
An  was a blow for Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. His Socialist party slumped to third place as the conservative People's Party triumphed. The result was even worse for Pablo Iglesias, the national leader of the radical-left Podemos; he had resigned as a deputy prime minister to run in the election, but his party came fifth. The pony-tailed Mr Iglesias said he would quit politics.
The European Commission said it would put its efforts to secure the ratification of an investment deal with China on hold. The European Parliament is refusing to consider ratification until China lifts sanctions on several of its members, after the EU imposed sanctions on China for abuses against the Uyghurs.
In a nasty , France threatened to cut off the electricity supply to the island of Jersey, a British dependency that lies close to the French coast. Britain sent two navy vessels to Jersey to monitor a protest by a flotilla of French fishing boats.

Joe Biden raised the cap on  to 62,500 for the fiscal year ending September 30th. The president had been chided by his fellow Democrats when last month he left the cap at 15,000, a historically low bar introduced by Donald Trump. Mr Biden said he would lift the cap again next year. Between October 1st 2020 and March 31st this year, only 2,050 refugees were admitted.
Several companies, including American Airlines and Microsoft, urged the Texas legislature to drop a bill that critics say would make it harder for Texans to vote.

Joshua Wong, a democracy activist in Hong Kong, was sentenced to another ten months in prison, this time for taking part in an annual vigil marking the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Results from  revealed that voters are turning away from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Cases are also rising across South-East Asia, with spikes in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as a handful of locally transmitted cases in Singapore, causing the city to restrict gatherings.
Teodoro “Teddy Boy” Locsin, the Philippines' foreign minister, issued a tweet asking China to “get the fuck out” of waters claimed by both countries. Mr Locsin later apologised, after his equally plainspoken president, Rodrigo Duterte, said that there was no need to be rude.
