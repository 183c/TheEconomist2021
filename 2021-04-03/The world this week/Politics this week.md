Underlining the , Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, threatened to try to stop the bloc from buying an extra 100m doses of Pfizer’s jab if his country did not get a bigger share. He has begun talks with Russia to buy vaccine. Britain, meanwhile, said a domestic factory would produce the new Novavax vaccine, which will reduce the country’s reliance on overseas production.
Despite surging infections Germany recommended that the AstraZeneca jab should be used mostly for the over-60s and limited among younger groups, because of concerns about blood-clotting. Angela Merkel said the country’s inoculation campaign “rests on the principle of trust”. The European Medicines Agency and the WHO continue to recommend the vaccine.

A commission in Britain that was created after last year’s Black Lives Matter protests to investigate racial disparities concluded that race is less important than social class and family structure in explaining inequality. On schooling, the report found that most children from ethnic-minority groups did as well or better than their white peers. It added that the catch-all term BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) was not very useful. The report contradicted the claims of critical race theorists, some of whom claim that white privilege is the prime cause of most disparities.

They killed dozens of people; witnesses reported seeing beheaded bodies in the streets. Thousands of survivors fled on boats to the provincial capital, Pemba.

The police in  said 45 people died in a stampede during a public viewing of the body of John Magufuli, the late president. Mr Magufuli, who fought covid-19 with quackery, was given a hero’s burial. Many believe he died of the virus.
’s army continued its brutal campaign to crush demonstrations against a military coup. More than 100 people were killed on March 27th, the holiday on which, in a grotesque irony, Myanmar celebrates the armed forces’ contribution to the country. That has brought the death toll since the coup to above 500.
Australia’s prime minister demoted two politicians caught up in sex scandals. Christian Porter, the attorney-general, had been accused of rape when a teenager; he denies it. Linda Reynolds, the defence minister, had called a former member of staff who claimed to have been raped in parliament “a lying cow”.
Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, replaced six key government ministers, including General Fernando Azevedo e Silva as minister of defence.

The African Union signed a deal with Johnson &amp; Johnson to supply 220m doses of its single-jab vaccine to member states starting later this year.
