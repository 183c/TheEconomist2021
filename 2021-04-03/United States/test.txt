He would spend $400bn on the care industry; and $180bn on research and development in low-carbon technologies. Such a spurge, which the administration claims it will pay for by hiking corporation taxes, would be unprecedented in recent decades.

How seriously should such talk be taken?","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"There are a few reasons to think Mr Biden will be able to pass his plan. The covid-19 crisis has exposed deep vulnerabilities and normalised vast federal expenditures.

His plan’s promise of incentives for firms that build supply chains at home points to that directly.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The crisis has also afforded Mr Biden an early opportunity to build momentum. Impressive as his administration’s messaging and grip have been, he inherited the pandemic at an opportune time, with vaccines available and unemployment dipping. And if the Trump administration set the conditions for progress, it also set a low bar for it. Merely by offering sensible advice and consolation to the bereaved, Mr Biden has presented a strong positive contrast with his predecessor.

Most important, it has united Mr Biden’s party behind him in fear and gratitude, giving him the wherewithal to pass legislation despite the fragility of its majority. The Republicans are meanwhile spiralling rudderless into cultural grievance—which, though not helpful in itself, is nevertheless usefully clarifying. Unlike Barack Obama, who is considered to have squandered his opportunity in a doomed search for bipartisan compromise, Mr Biden knows he must look to his party to pass laws. His infrastructure plan appears to have been drafted largely on that basis. A last-minute change to cover it through tax rises, not deficit spending, appears to have been in response to Mr Biden’s most demanding Democratic colleague, Senator Joe Manchin.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Thus has the administration made headway and, at this early stage, shown a clearer sense of purpose than perhaps any since Ronald Reagan’s. Mr Biden has not been distracted by events, including the latest gun massacres and border mess. Even Republicans say his modest talents have never looked better. Hill Democrats expect to pass three substantial pieces of legislation, including the covid package and probably an infrastructure one, before the mid-term elections.
