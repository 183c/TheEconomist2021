Mao argued with party chiefs in far-off Shanghai about how to recruit peasants as revolutionary warriors, after urban uprisings failed. Some sharp rows concerned the merits of political terror, and whether to seize land from all landlords, or just the richest. Mao favoured a selective use of violence. He held public-execution rallies at which local gentry were disembowelled with spears, and hung a scaffold with couplets in his own calligraphy, reading: “Watch Us Kill the Bad Landlords Today. Aren’t You Afraid?” Mao eagerly recruited mountain bandits as troops and grumbled about the “petty-bourgeois consciousness” of villagers, who rarely volunteered to join the Red Army, wanting instead to farm in peace. When an enemy army drew near in January 1929, Mao abandoned Jinggang Mountain, leaving only a token force to defend thousands of villagers, wounded troops and Red Army wives and children. Massacres followed. An official history published in 1987, during a period of relative candour about Mao’s mistakes, cites a party inspector’s judgment that the Red Army’s 15-month stay left Jinggang Mountain “totally bankrupt”.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Such debates are now played down.

Smoothly, academy students trace a common “Red culture” connecting early martyrs with material prosperity today. One student, a party chief at a university in central China, recounts how he ferried his son on a bicycle in the 1990s, whereas his soon-to-be-born grandchild will ride in a car. Definitions of happiness evolve, but “the people have always had dreams of a better life,” he beams.
