His father, a rose-grower in Hereford, England, was an avid birder too, but Mr Williamson brought to the pastime the focused effort and aptitude for the collection of information that also characterised his work as a macroeconomist and expert on exchange rates. Birding was an understated hobby for an understated man. Yet Mr Williamson gained a measure of fame that eludes most economists when he outlined the “Washington consensus”: a description of policy orthodoxy in the late 1980s that became a flashpoint for intense global debate. Mr Williamson, who died on April 11th at the age of 83, sought merely to gather a list of macroeconomic best practices, the better to boost the welfare of people in developing economies. In that he succeeded, the furore that followed notwithstanding.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Though Mr Williamson had notions of becoming an engineer, a schoolteacher suggested that his maths was too poor, and that he should pursue economics instead.

Its original context is often forgotten. In the 1960s and 1970s, booming Latin American countries borrowed heavily to fund infrastructure projects and industrialisation. When interest rates soared in the early 1980s, those debts became unpayable and a wave of defaults threatened. American politicians, fearing for their country’s heavily exposed banks, introduced a series of plans to coax as much repayment as possible from the region. They grew frustrated, however, at what they took to be Latin American governments’ lack of interest in structural reform. Mr Williamson—who by then had moved to what is now the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank—knew better, and proposed convening a conference to correct such misapprehensions. He wrote a document to help frame the proceedings; the Washington consensus was described within.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The paper sought to capture what Washington’s intelligentsia agreed were broadly sensible policies. There were ten planks, which Mr Williamson later summarised as encompassing “macroeconomic discipline, a market economy, and openness to the world”. Wild-eyed radicalism it was not; the list was intended after all to reflect only the policies that almost everyone in Washington thought wise. Mr Williamson did not endorse knee-jerk austerity; he emphasised redirecting industrial subsidies towards education and health. Exchange rates should be competitive, but not necessarily freely floating. Openness meant acceptance of imports and direct investment, but not full capital mobility. Deregulation meant liberating sheltered sectors, not gutting environmental and labour standards. It was more a practical guide to avoiding disaster than a manifesto.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The consensus soon came to mean something else entirely, though. Critics associated it with the ideological revolutions of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, which they interpreted as fierce hostility to any state intervention. When financial crises racked the developing world in the 1990s, its woes were blamed on the consensus, which was caricatured as a foolhardy attempt to impose orthodoxy on vulnerable places regardless of local conditions. The term became a catchall for neoliberalism, its excesses and failures, real and imagined. Economists found themselves asking whether and how the consensus had gone wrong; Mr Williamson himself acknowledged in 2002 that the term had become a “damaged brand name”.
