IF THE MANHATTAN skyline represents one urban ideal, the view from the white bridge in Welwyn Garden City reveals another. To the south stretches a mile-long parkway, lavishly wide, planted with grass, flowers and a fountain. On one side is an orderly shopping district. Curved roads spread out from the town centre, filled with two-storey houses, trees, hedges and verges—a perfectly controlled blend of urban and rural. Although it is a century old, you can still sense the confidence of its designer. No wonder the locals are fighting to protect it.
Welwyn Garden City was the second garden city to be built in Britain, after Letchworth, a few miles to the north in Hertfordshire. It was also the last. The idea and some of the money came from Ebenezer Howard, a farmer turned urban visionary who wanted to strike a balance between polluted, slummy cities and boring villages. His towns promised decent houses and fresh air but also factory jobs. He tried calling his new amalgam “rurisville” and “town-country” before settling on “garden city”.

Contemporaries were confused and suspicious. One critic called Howard’s proposal “a hermaphrodite”. The writer George Orwell maintained that Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City were inhabited by feminists, sandal-wearers, yoga enthusiasts and “fruit-juice-drinkers”. Such people seemed more alarming in the 1930s than they do today.
Howard and his towns nonetheless proved hugely influential. Garden cities popped up in America, Australia, Finland and Israel. Wei Yang, who has planned garden cities in China, describes Howard’s ideas as the foundation of modern town planning. She argues that some newly fashionable ideas, such as the “15-minute city” popularised by the mayor of Paris (the idea being that urbanites can fulfil most of their needs locally, without driving) can be traced back to Howard.
But a threat to Howard’s legacy is now growing in the industrial district that he and his chief architect, Louis de Soissons, created in Welwyn Garden City. Where factories once stood, eight-storey blocks of flats are being built—some of them for sale, some for rent, some intended for retired people. The developers are seeking permission to put up other blocks of as many as ten storeys.
Locals complain that the proposed developments are far too dense and massive. Howard stipulated that Welwyn Garden City should have up to 12 homes per acre, which is about 30 per hectare. The developers of one site, next to a disused Shredded Wheat factory, want to build 257 homes per hectare (not including the surrounding roads). “If they do this, how can Welwyn Garden City continue to call itself a garden city?” asks Tony Skottowe, chair of a local heritage group.
The new blocks would indeed change the character of Welwyn Garden City. They would create a new centre a few hundred metres from the existing one, and would loom over the eastern half of the town. But the developers have one strong argument. If the inhabitants of Welwyn Garden City do not want tower blocks, they ask, how exactly do they plan to create thousands of new homes?
The British government requires many local authorities to build more homes. The borough that includes Welwyn Garden City has promised to create 12,000 between 2013 and 2032 (which will probably not be enough to satisfy the government). But its options are few. Because the town lies within London’s green belt, it cannot easily spread out—as it did after the second world war, when de Soissons was asked to oversee a new plan that made it twice as big. Nor can a nearby village readily be turned into a new town, which is what Howard expected to happen when one of his creations reached its limit. Building upwards is the easiest option.
Welwyn Garden City is a masterpiece of town planning, hugely influential around the world. But planning rules can be destructive, too. The green belt holds the town like a noose, slowly tightening.■
