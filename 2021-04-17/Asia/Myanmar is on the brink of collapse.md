IT WOULD BE hours before Hla Hla Win felt any pain, which was just as well. It was the morning of March 27th and more than a thousand people, Ms Hla Hla Win among them, had gathered in Yangon to protest against the army’s coup. When security forces began firing automatic weapons into the crowd, she fled the scene, but not quickly enough to avoid being shot in the hand. Her father, waiting nearby on his motorbike, drove her to the nearest clinic. But as they drew towards it, they saw it was surrounded by armed soldiers.
Ms Hla Hla Win, a 17-year-old student whose name The Economist has changed for her safety, retreated home cradling her hand, which now resembled “a bag closed with a drawstring”. She did not receive treatment until mid-afternoon, at a monastery where doctors loyal to the resistance had set up a mobile clinic. But lacking the proper equipment, they could not set the broken bone. When the pain finally set in, says her mother, she cried and cried. It was four days before she had an operation.

Last November Myanmar held a general election that returned Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, and her government to power. On February 1st the army seized power in a coup, claiming without evidence that the poll, which its party had lost resoundingly, had been marred by voter fraud. The public disagreed, and hundreds of thousands of Burmese marched through the streets. But after two weeks, with the protests showing no signs of abating, the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, put his foot down.
Since then, he has presided over a reign of terror. At night, shouting soldiers enter residential areas, conduct house-to-house searches, indiscriminately fire live rounds into buildings, and beat and arrest people suspected of opposing the coup. Over 3,000 people have been jailed; some have been tortured. By day, security services attack protesters and random passers-by with assault weapons and grenades; many have been shot in the head. No mercy is shown to medical staff and doctors, who have been beaten, arrested and killed. On April 9th the army massacred 82 people in Bago, a town in the centre of the country. Local activists say the Tatmadaw, as the army is known, is charging families 120,000 kyat ($85) to retrieve the bodies. The death toll now exceeds 700.

The junta thinks it can crush the protests using the tactics it deployed against ethnic insurgencies that have simmered in the remote borderlands for decades. To that end it has sent large contingents of battle-hardened troops into the country’s biggest cities, including the divisions allegedly responsible for atrocities in 2017 against the Rohingyas, an ethnic minority.
Since early March the army has set up bases in schools, universities and monasteries. Not only do such places make convenient billets, but occupying them deprives its opponents of places to congregate. Hospitals are especially soft targets. The security forces are arresting wounded protesters who seek medical treatment. Ms Hla Hla Win would have been captured by police at the hospital where she was operated on, if plucky nurses had not wheeled her to safety in the nick of time.
The Tatmadaw is brutalising the very people it is sworn to protect. Yet Burmese refuse to back down. Demonstrations continue, though in cities they are smaller than they were in February. Many protesters are pouring their energies into defending their neighbourhoods by building barricades to make it harder for soldiers to enter. Some are attacking troops with rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails, and even inflicting casualties of their own. On April 10th, in Tamu, a town near the border with India, locals lobbed grenades at a military convoy, killing at least 18 soldiers.
Hundreds of people from the centre of the country, which is dominated by the Bamar, the ethnic majority, have travelled to the territories of five different ethnic-minority militias to learn the arts of war. “Myanmar stands at the brink of state failure,” Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organisation based in Brussels, told the UN Security Council on April 9th.
Strike, counter-strike
The most effective tactic of the resistance has been a general strike. The junta seeks legitimacy by styling itself an effective manager of the state and the economy. By staying at home, tens of thousands of workers—from civil servants and truck drivers to teachers and doctors—have in effect locked the generals out of civilian administration. Schools and public hospitals are shut. Most bank branches have been closed since shortly after the coup. This has had a huge effect: it is almost impossible to conduct back-office functions, including payroll and interbank transfers. Strikers have prised the levers of government and the economy from the clutch of the generals, rendering the junta unable to govern, says Kim Jolliffe, an analyst.
The generals have tried to force banks to reopen, threatening everything from fines to nationalisation. But many employees are simply too scared to venture outside and head for work. By the junta’s own estimate, just 10% of branches are functioning again. Worried about a run on the banks, the regime has placed limits on withdrawals. “The generals seem unaware that they have destroyed the two most important economic commodities: trust and confidence,” notes the Crisis Group.
Predictably, the economy is seizing up. The World Bank thinks it will shrink by 10% this year. In a report titled “Economic collapse awaits Myanmar”, Fitch Solutions, the research arm of the ratings company, predicts a contraction twice as big. Supply chains are breaking down due to strikes by customs agents, dockworkers, lorry drivers and rail workers. Goods that do make it into port are mouldering there. So many ports are paralysed that some shipping firms have halted services to the country. Goods exports are likely to plunge by more than 60% this financial year, reckons Fitch Solutions. Disruptions to the internet are not helping.
To prevent a descent into total chaos, activists have engaged in a flurry of organising. Hunger was already a problem in Myanmar, where a quarter of the population subsists on less than $1.15 a day. The economic crisis is deepening privation. Campaigners and charities are opening food banks and raising money for strikers. In some districts where most civil servants have joined the civil-disobedience movement, they are providing rudimentary health care and managing to keep the lights on and water running, says Philipp Annawitt, who was an adviser to the deposed Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, Myanmar’s parliament.
These are short-term fixes. The resistance is pinning its hopes for a resolution to the crisis on the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of deposed MPs who have formed a provisional government. Confident that it has the loyalty of the Bamar majority, the committee is seeking legitimacy and help on the international stage, and assiduously courting ethnic minorities. It has no guns, but the 20 ethnic militias scattered around the borderlands have plenty. It will need their support if it is to stand a chance of prevailing against the Tatmadaw.
To that end, it talks of drawing on the militias to form a “federal army”. Such a force would have little chance of defeating the Tatmadaw in combat. The regular army, numbering some 350,000, dwarfs the militias’ combined force of 75,000. And the guerillas’ style of warfare is not suited to lowland areas, where they would inevitably be drawn into open battle with the Tatmadaw. But if the insurgents begin stepping up their attacks on the army, “that would spread the military very thin”, says Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington.
The CRPH is trying to win over minorities by promising to realise their dream of turning Myanmar into a federal union. Yet ethnic political parties are wary of signing up. The CRPH is dominated by Bamar politicians, who have a history of marginalising minorities. Politicians from minorities tend not to trust their Bamar counterparts, or each other. Some militias have clashed with each other over territory and money. Getting them to set aside their differences may prove difficult.
Join the committee
Yet there are signs that the CRPH’s charm offensive is converting some. Ten ethnic militias that signed a nationwide ceasefire agreement with the military government in 2015 have walked away from it and have collectively expressed their support for the CRPH. The two largest groups, the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Restoration Council of Shan State, have each had meetings with the CRPH. The KNU has provided armed protection to demonstrations in its territory and granted asylum to members of the CRPH fleeing areas controlled by the Tatmadaw. The army may already be struggling. Even if there is no consensus among the militias towards the CRPH, they are almost all at least “in passive opposition” to the army, says Mr Jolliffe.
The Tatmadaw is the most resilient institution in Myanmar. Soldiers and their families live in cantonments, separated from the rest of society. They are indoctrinated into believing that the Tatmadaw is essential to the country’s survival. There have been almost no desertions.And even if some wanted to defect, doing so would provoke reprisals against their families. The generals can afford to suffer large casualties and, thanks to their involvement in the trafficking of Myanmar’s abundant natural resources, can probably weather the collapse of the formal economy. “I think they’re able to sustain this for the long haul,” says Mr Abuza.
What they cannot do is repair the damage to their reputation. Ethnic minorities, long oppressed by the Tatmadaw, were never under any illusions about the army. But many Bamar regarded it as the guardian of a nation forever at risk of falling apart. Now that the army has turned on the Bamar, they can see the generals for who they really are: defenders not of the country, but of their own interests. ■
